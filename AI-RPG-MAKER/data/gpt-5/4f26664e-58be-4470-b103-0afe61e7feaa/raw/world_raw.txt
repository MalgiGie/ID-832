"{\n  \"city\": \"Marrowgate is a city built within and around the titanic fossil of a sky-wyrm whose ribs arch like alabaster bridges over a chasm carved by the River of No Echo. Seven districts, called the Seven Ribs, ring a central hollow where the sternum once lay, now paved as Sternum Plaza and lined with scrimshawed obelisks that tally treaties, debts, and dead. The Skull Keep crowns the northern brink, its cavernous eye-sockets lantern-lit as the council hall glows within the cranial vault. The First Rib is dockside and damp, ruled by sluice-gates and the cant of boatmen; the Second Rib smokes with kilns and bone-lime; the Third Rib chants with reliquaries and prayer; the Fourth Rib instructs with bone-lore and osteomancy; the Fifth Rib hawks, haggles, and files serrated wares in the Bone-Market; the Sixth Rib parades bone-inlaid townhouses and the scribe-banks; the Seventh Rib sprawls in lantern-dim alleys and rope-bridges along the tailward ward. Established three centuries ago when scavengers-turned-settlers traced the wyrm’s vertebral canal to springwater and safety during the Ash Rains, Marrowgate rose from survival into a center of bonecraft, canal mastery, and contract-magic. Its currency is the chit, a scrimshawed sliver whose carvings match paired registries held by the Loom of Names. Governance nominally belongs to the Custodian of the Remains—currently Lady Sereth Vex—but practical power resides with the Council of Cartilages, guild delegates who argue beneath ribs that creak when oaths are broken. Legends say the wyrm died dueling the Lantern King, a fallen star sovereign whose surrender etched the chasm’s course; others claim the wyrm chose to sleep here to pin shut a wound in the world. On windless nights, the bones hum with river-tremor, and those who listen swear they catch words. Taboos forbid the breaking of bearing-bones, the selling of names without consent, and the summoning of voices from the Mire of Quiet Dust. Prosperity depends on the river gates, bone ash for kilns, trade with the Nadiri caravans, and a delicate truce with the Grave-Binders, whose sigil-cord oaths keep the city’s dead at rest. Conflicts fester between artisans who profit by burning relics and priests who guard them, between scribes who own debts and smugglers who erase them, between zealots who would wake the wyrm and wardens who would drown them in lockwater.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ossuary Dunes\",\n      \"type\": \"Shifting bone-sand desert\",\n      \"distance\": \"1.5 days south by caravan\",\n      \"description\": \"A bleached expanse of pulverized bone and wind-carved femurs jutting like reef spines.
