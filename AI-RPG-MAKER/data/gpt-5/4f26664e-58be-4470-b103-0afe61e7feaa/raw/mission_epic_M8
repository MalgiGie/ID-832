Waymother Safra Ninebridges lays a bridge-feast on a wind-bitten ridge of the Ossuary Dunes, lanterns guttering in bowls of salt, and speaks of contracts cinched too tight by Riverwarden austerity until trade itself wheezes. She promises guidance if trust can be coaxed to life, if not by the city’s bruised writ then by a new guarantee stitched to the Loom of Names and to the marrow-script of Iriel Vask’s own name. The dunes sing like an empty cathedral as the wind threads the holes of old bones, and bone squalls rise without warning to strip skin and patience, leaving the unready gasping and the unwary buried. Sinkfields yawn and swallow carts like quiet mouths, and only those who read the wind’s fret and the sand’s dimples keep their feet. In the lee of towering femur-spires, the Hollow Pilgrims skulk and hiss prayers to awaken the dead wyrm and erase all debts as if names and laws were shallow scratches in a deeper fossil. To take the fragment that sleeps beneath a whistling vent, Iriel must walk the line between oath and need, for no bearing-bone may be broken and no taboo may be snapped for haste. The bargain sealed on these dunes will carry the river’s weight as surely as any gate, and the tone it strikes with Nadiri hearts will ring long after sand has blown flat.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Negotiate with Safra Ninebridges for passage and aid in retrieving a pre-wyrm ossature fragment, balancing city writs and Nadiri salt-law without slighting either.\",\n        \"Survive a razor-breath bone squall and navigate subducting sinkfields to a whistling vent where the denser pre-wyrm bone protrudes like an old rib through sand.\",\n        \"Drive off or evade the Hollow Pilgrims without breaking bearing-bones or violating the Accords of Quiet Dust and the city’s standing taboos.\",\n        \"Secure the ossature fragment intact and agree terms for Nadiri compensation that honor fair weight, fair hearing, and future passage.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Safra Ninebridges\", \"lines\": \"You come with the city’s need on your tongue and the city’s writ in your satchel, and I like neither taste in a drought. We guided your grandparents through these bones when the Ash Rains were a fresh story, and it was our lanterns that kept your forerunners from walking off the edges of night. Now the Riverwardens count our steps and tighten the Salt-Tithe like a noose, as if tides were theirs to leash and not a covenant between shore and road. Share my salt, traveler, and we will talk as those who remember that a bridge holds only when both banks lean in. Promise me a fair weight and a fair hearing, and I will show you where the old giants still shrug in their sleep and where the wind sings their names without asking a scribe’s leave.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iriel Vask\", \"lines\": \"The gate that takes your keels takes our food, and the bearing that fails will drown the market where we both barter, so I come with need and not with mastery. I cannot unmake a tithe by syllable, but I can carry your grievance into the Skull Keep and stand within the lantern-glow until a councilor names it aloud. My mentors taught me to hear when bone and promise slip out of tune, and I swear I will speak until the tone comes right or my voice rasps to a thread. Help me bring a bone that does not break, and I will help you bend a custom that has grown cruel without breaking the law that keeps our dead quiet. If trust will not stir for the city’s writ alone, then I will risk my own name-cord and petition the Loom to braid a guarantee that honors salt and ledger both.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Hollow Pilgrim Zealot\", \"lines\": \"Sleep is a lie here, little lantern, and debt is the lullaby that keeps you from waking. The wyrm’s skull is a bell and the city a clapper, and one hard strike will shake loose all your cords and all your careful names. Gates are wounds held shut by frightened hands, and tithes are scabs you pick because you forgot how to heal. Lay down your ash cords and your flute and walk with us to the lee of the femur, where the sand remembers a deeper law that makes all ledgers moot. Wake the wyrm with us, and watch the river unthread and the Council fall silent like candles pinched by dawn.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Safra Ninebridges\", \"lines\": \"Step back, priest of holes, for under my salt none are taken by wind, blade, or borrowed revelation. We build bridges where there is nothing and teach feet to trust the air, and your faith digs pits for people to vanish into. Iriel, take the shard with both hands and do not look at its shadows, for the dunes lie with silhouettes as well as tongues. When the wind lifts, bend low and move with it, and when the sand stills, count to nine before you step or a sinkfield will drink you bone and breath. The dunes sing to the slow listener and bury the fast one, and today we will be slow in our listening and true in our steps.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Lean on the city’s writ and ask for Nadiri trust\", \"text\": \"At the bridge-feast you lay the city’s seal beside the salt and speak without swagger, admitting that a writ is only as strong as those who believe it will be honored. You ask Safra to lend her caravan court’s weight to a joint petition, a procession from the Dunes to Sternum Plaza that will force the Council to hear, and you promise to bear the brunt of the speaking when the ledger-men bristle. You describe how the gatework saves Nadiri keels as surely as it saves Marrowgate kitchens, and you make clear that your request is a mutual preservation, not a purchase. You promise to carry named grievances in proper form, to read them aloud beneath the ribs, and to stand witness if any clause is hedged in weasel words. You finish by setting your own salt pinch onto the bowl, a small vow that you will accept blame if any messenger tries to turn this trust into a trap.\", \"outcome\": \"Safra studies you as the wind tests the lamplight, and at last she nods and sets her own salt beside yours, binding talk to a compact. The Nadiri agree to guide you to the whistling vent and to stand as witnesses when the petition is brought before the city, their song a counterpoint to the Council’s bone-echo. The path to the fragment opens with fewer detours, for caravan outriders know which dunes are hungry and which only sigh, and they teach you to listen for the sand’s swallow. You reach the vent windburned but unbroken, and the fragment comes free under patient hands and ropes without cracking a single bearing-bone. Word of the accord drifts upriver, and while some Riverwardens grumble, others quietly mark that you saved their gates with respect, a small rise in regard that may steady future crossings.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Pledge a Loom-backed guarantee with your own name\", \"text\": \"You take out your scrimshawed chit case and show the stub of your name-cord, explaining the lien you already bear and the risks you are willing to shoulder further. You propose that the Loom of Names co-sign a provisional guarantee for Nadiri compensation tied to delivery of the pre-wyrm fragment, with penalties upon your own cord if the city stalls. You do not beg, and you do not bluff, but you speak of the city’s habit of listening only when names are braided into a rope they cannot cut without screaming. You promise to send a green-shutter message to the Scribehouse and to stand in the audit hall if the Loom demands a face when the cord is tightened. You end by admitting that this vow will cost you years, but say that a city that keeps its gates is worth the seasons you will owe.\", \"outcome\": \"Safra weighs the offer and hears the iron at its core, for among the Nadiri it is known that a person who risks their name risks their sleep and their future. She accepts, and your lamp blinks green to Phosphor House while her outrider rides a crescent to a secluded ridge, and between shutter and sand the Loom replies with a reluctant, binding hum. A provisional writ arrives in frost-script upon a bone tile, your cord number braided into the margin like a vein, and Safra presses her tide-mark onto its edge, sealing it as if it were a caravan ledger. The path to the vent is swift and exacting, and though the bone squall cuts your cheeks with glass-fine sand, the fragment is hauled free with songs that keep the ropes from slipping. You feel the weight of debt settle like a small stone in the pocket of your heart, but you also feel the gates at First Rib stir as if relieved, and some Riverwardens will later nod to you with a respect they reserve for those who pay for what they ask.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Evade the Hollow Pilgrims with resonance and sand-craft\", \"text\": \"You caution the caravan to silence and set the Fourth-Rib bone flute to your lips, sounding a low tone that weaves through the dunes like a thread that imitates the river’s hush. You smear ash from the warden cords across your boots to dull your prints and lead the party along the lee of a rib where footprints collapse back into themselves. You time each step to the gaps in the wind, moving when the dunes sing loudest so breath and grit mask the scrape of rope and sled. You teach the nearest outriders to hum a counter-tone, and soon the caravan is a melody that lives in the gusts and not in the ears of lurking zealots. When the bone squall leaps the ridge with a hiss like boiling teeth, you bury lanterns, bow heads, and let the sand pass over like a blessing withheld, and afterward there is no trail for pursuers to read.\", \"outcome\": \"The Hollow Pilgrims drift like moths toward the wrong edge of the song, peering into a mirage that reflects their own hunger back at them while your company moves as a shadow beneath ribs. You reach the whistling vent with hearts pounding but skins intact, and the fragment is coaxed up with care, its weight speaking of old storms and older oaths. Not a bearing-bone is nicked, and no taboo is tested, for even the cords you lay are laid with permission and lifted with thanks. Safra’s glance carries real respect now, a recognition of craft that saves lives without taking any, and her people pass you water that tastes of mint and ash as a sign you are under their road’s favor. The Riverwardens will later hear that no fight was needed and mark that discipline kept the peace, and the Nadiri will remember that you chose subtlety over spectacle, a memory that spends like coin when roads grow thin.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Confront the Hollow Pilgrims with a parley that bites but does not cut\", \"text\": \"You step out onto the windward face of the femur-spire and plant a small circle of salt, inviting the Pilgrims to speak across a line that holds tongues as well as feet. You name the Accords of Quiet Dust and remind them that to rattle bearing-bones is to rattle the dead who trusted the living to keep them quiet, and you speak this not as a threat but as a grief. You tell them the wyrm’s sleep is not their hammer and that the river is not their anvil, and that debts can be argued without swinging at skulls. You offer them a hearing before the Order of the Third Rib and a chance to lay their case where oaths are weighed and not burned, and you promise to carry their words exactly if they will carry their blades away whole. You keep your hands visible, the flute at your belt and the cords in your satchel, and you hold their eyes until the wind blinks first.\", \"outcome\": \"The zealots seethe, some hungry for spectacle, but most still have enough marrow in them to feel the weight of the salt line and the memory of mothers named at dusk. They spit on the sand and promise to return with more mouths, yet they retreat along the ridge, muttering about councils and bells and the day when names will be unbraided. Your caravan moves on without a fight, the dune’s attention drifting elsewhere, and the fragment is taken with patient hands and steady breaths. Safra marks that you turned knives into words and left with both intact, and her court will later admit that such turns are worth more on the long road than victories that bleed. The city’s wardens will hear that you kept taboo and law both, and though the Pilgrims become a shadow that may lengthen later, for now the road narrows behind you and widens in front.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M7\"], \"next\": [\"M9\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"experience\", \"description\": \"650 experience for braving the Ossuary Dunes, holding to taboos, and sealing terms under salt and wind.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Pre-Wyrm Bearing Fragment, a denser ossature suited to reinforce the stabilized gates without cracking under pressure surges.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Nadiri Tide-Name Token, a carved favor that opens bridge-feasts and proves earned passage among caravan courts.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"currency\", \"description\": \"22 chits in matched scrimshawed slivers, ledger-paired to your cord and delivered with Nadiri witness.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Nadiri Caravan Court reputation +3 for honoring salt-law and negotiating fair compensation.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Riverwardens of the No Echo reputation +1 for securing reinforcement that keeps the gates true without breaking bearing-bones.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
