A knack for resonance led to apprenticeship at the Pale Collegium, where Archivist Lysa Truin noticed that Iriel could hear when bone and promise were out of tune. Under Lysa's guidance, Iriel mapped echo-lines between the Cathedral of the Third Rib and the Sluiceworks, showing how oath-hum rode canal pressure. When a silent surge threatened the First Rib gates, Gatewright Suri Yal brought Iriel below the lock crowns to listen; together they tuned the bearings with star-glass shims and stopped a collapse. That success earned a standing canal pass and a permanent frown from Harbormaster Jull Nerr, who mistrusts scholars meddling with his river. Iriel's research now skirts city taboos: a bone flute tuned to the Fourth Rib has answered the Cartographer's Needle, and maps in Iriel's care sometimes redraw themselves at dusk. A restricted descent at the Wyrmwell, arranged off-ledger with Suri, nearly ended in disaster when the cartilage gate sang back. Jull Nerr hauled them out by militia order and would have revoked all passes if Lysa had not vouched that the work might save the city in a true flood. Since then, Iriel works between Collegium lecture halls, the Sluiceworks' thunder, and lantern-dim alleys where rumors run faster than water, trying to keep bone, glass, and name in tune while the Seven Ribs creak with old arguments.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Fourth-Rib Bone Flute\",\n      \"description\": \"Cut and tuned to the Collegium's fourth-rib pitch; when sounded at dawn or dusk it harmonizes with standing structures and reveals stress and hidden seams; rumored to resonate with the Cartographer's Needle.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Resonant Star-Glass Forks\",\n      \"description\": \"A roll of three tuning forks tempered at Ember Kilnworks with Skyfall shards; each holds a stable tone used to test gates, oaths, and relic wards.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Osteomancer's Satchel\",\n      \"description\": \"Bone chalks, ash cords, scrimshaw calipers, and binding inks sourced from the Pale Collegium; includes a pocket ledger for sigil sketches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Green-Shutter Lantern\",\n      \"description\": \"A compact lamp with a Grey Lanterns filter plate that casts a low-green light; can signal truce tones and read frost-script on bone tiles at Sternum Plaza.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Scrimshawed Chit Case\",\n      \"description\": \"Holds matched sliver-chits and a sealed name-cord stub registered with the Loom of Names; useful for fees and formal petitions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Warden Cord Set\",\n      \"description\": \"Knotted ash-cords for temporary pacification of disturbed remnants per the Accords of Quiet Dust; lawful for trained Collegium auxiliaries.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Underway Maps and Rubbings\",\n      \"description\": \"Annotated maps of the underways and a rubbing taken from the Cartographer's Needle base; edges sometimes shift at dusk.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 8,\n    \"agility\": 11,\n    \"constitution\": 10,\n    \"intelligence\": 17,\n    \"wisdom\": 15,\n    \"charisma\": 12,\n    \"dexterity\": 13,\n    \"endurance\": 10,\n    \"perception\": 16,\n    \"luck\": 9\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Analytical thinking and pattern recognition\",\n    \"Diplomacy across rival guilds\",\n    \"Composure under pressure and crisis response\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Lysa Truin\": \"Mentor and protector at the Pale Collegium; grants supervised access to restricted resonance archives and shields Iriel from political blowback when research treads near taboo.\",\n    \"Suri Yal\": \"Trusted collaborator at the First Rib Sluiceworks; co-devised bearing tunes that prevented a lock failure, and shares clandestine curiosity about the Wyrmwell's cartilage gate.\",\n    \"Jull Nerr\": \"Cautious patron-adversary; recognizes Iriel's value when the gates sing wrong but keeps them on a short cord, threatening canal pass revocation after any unsanctioned descent.\"\n  },\n  \"ambitions\": \"Open the archive beneath the Cartographer's Needle without breaking a single taboo, prove that resonance can reconcile guild interests, and design a bone-song protocol that keeps the River of No Echo tame through flood and famine.\",\n  \"flaws\": \"Restless curiosity that edges into rule-bending, a name-cord lien that makes independence fragile, and a tendency to trust systems and harmonics more than people until crisis forces connection.\",\n  \"dreams\": \"To hear the wyrm's last breath and learn whether it died to seal a wound or to spare the city, then compose a binding that lets Marrowgate hum in peace rather than creak under debt and fear.\",\n  \"secrets\": \"Iriel sold a sliver of their own name to the Loom of Names to fund early studies and hides the lingering obligations; during a shardstorm at Skyfall, the bone flute answered the Cartographer's Needle and opened a momentary door, from which Iriel took a map rubbing not entered into any ledger; once, lost in the Mire of Quiet Dust, Iriel accepted the Dustmother's first sleep and has not fully confessed the memory-dimming calm it brought.\"\n}"
