Wind roved the steppe in long, low breaths, combing razor grass around menhirs set like ribcages under the storm-bellied sky, their faces half-seen and weather-sanded into listening. Iriel Vask carried the Vessel of the Wyrm’s Breath as one carries a sleeping child, feeling the bound breath hum as a cool pressure against the palms, like rain remembered by bone. Lady Sereth Vex strode at the fore with her cloak pinned by a shard of skull-suture, her voice the iron of a vow and the ache of its price, while couriers and wardens kept pace and kept silence. Close behind came Leth Morrow with Nalai Thread, cords looped like serpents around spare-inked wrists, and Avar Ir’s presence crackled with furnace confidence as if she had walked out of a kiln with slag still singing in her veins. Edris Thale of the Third Rib murmured prayers like knots tied against lightning, and Safra Ninebridges trod light, a bridge-name in step and stance, weighing tolls and futures in the lines of her mouth. They reached the menhir circle where earth sank as if something vast had once lain down to rest, and under the central stone the hidden bell answered the city’s blood. When Sereth bared her palm and bled into the grass, the taboo was honored and the stone soldiers rose in stillness, not to march, but to bear witness, their hollow faces turned to the vessel as thunder sought iron and found only resolve. The oldest council gathered not by summons of office but of obligation to history, and the storm’s drum became the cadence of a hearing older than charters. The Needle’s map in Iriel’s satchel pulsed like a second heartbeat, insisting that the route had always ended here, where the breath would be poured not into gates or coffers, but into the city’s unbraided name, so that Marrowgate might finally be allowed to speak for itself, to loose and re-tie debts without strangling the poor or freeing the cruel, and to choose a song it could endure.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Travel to the Hollow March with the Vessel of the Wyrm’s Breath and the Council deputation.\",\n        \"Unearth and ring the Bone Bell using Sereth Vex’s blood to summon the oldest council.\",\n        \"Mediate between Leth Morrow, Avar Ir, Safra Ninebridges, and Edris Thale to form the Accord of Living Flow.\",\n        \"Pour the wyrm’s breath into the city’s unbraided name-cord without violating taboos.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sereth Vex\", \"lines\": \"If we are to be governed, let it be by our better selves, and let the bones that sheltered us from the Ash Rains remember we kept faith. I did not drag this council through wind that hunts iron to crown a single rib fat while the others starve and grind. We will not drink the breath like thieves of weather, nor hoard it like chits in a ledger no one living can read without shame. Bind the breath to our name, braid it where no hand claims sole mastery, and let the city hum a refusal whenever someone seeks to make tool or trinket of its people. If the sky hates presumption, let it hate me first; I will bleed and ring the bell and answer for it in any court that keeps a conscience.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Leth Morrow\", \"lines\": \"Names are not toys, nor are they charms pressed under the tongue to sweeten bitter bargains, and I have seen what happens when a cord is lied into. To pour a storm into a name is to risk unmaking the grammar by which we speak each other into fairness, and to invite a music that may not stop at our borders. But a ledger is not merely a chain; it is also a memory that cannot be conveniently forgotten, and memory is the only court that endures. If the breath must enter a cord, then it must do so by witnessed measure, with loops that forbid strangulation and knots that refuse to bind the throat of the poor. Give me the braid to hold, and make your argument not to power but to precedent, and I will sign where the city can read its own mercy without going blind.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Safra Ninebridges\", \"lines\": \"I will sign a bridge over a river I cannot own if I am allowed to keep my feet on both banks and not be pushed into the current by either. My people brought bread and coal in winters when your gates froze, and we asked for tolls you could afford because we intended to come back again in the spring. Thread this cord so it hears salt on the tongue, and song in the rope-lines, not only your tallies etched by silent hands in quiet halls. A city that forgets its roads forgets its lungs, and a throat that closes itself does not sing but chokes. Show me a clause that protects the wayfarer, the peddler, and the child who sleeps on a wagon plank, and I will teach my grandchildren that this was the day Marrowgate remembered who carried it when it was still too small to walk.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Avar Ir\", \"lines\": \"The kilns do not feed themselves, and a city that scorns its furnaces will eat glass in its bread and ash in its sleep, because neglect is always swallowed last and longest. I do not ask that we pour this breath into our chimneys or our retorts, for even I know a taboo that keeps us a people and not a furnace that learned to speak. But bind a promise that when the heat rises we will share it by rule and not by riot, and that ash will be weighed by justice and not by jealousy. Give industry a voice in the braid and we will temper our flame to the city’s song, annealing strength rather than shattering it with sudden temperature. Let the Accord remember that bellies are not warmed by hymns alone, and I will shoulder the first tithe of fuel when the flood season steals our coal.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Edris Thale\", \"lines\": \"The Remains are not raw material but covenant, and a people that steals its dead to stoke its living forgets that it too will one day lie quiet and hope not to be consumed. I will bless this act if it guards the boundary between counsel and compulsion, and if it forbids the selling of a name like a trinket at the Fifth Rib. Breath poured into a cord becomes memory, and memory becomes law by habit; see that the habit we begin tonight is mercy disciplined by duty. Let there be clauses that lift the poor without laundering the cruel, and that bind the powerful without cutting the city into punishments and profits. I will set my hand to a vow that keeps the Bone Bell silent afterwards, not because we fear to summon it, but because we have learned to listen before we dare to ring.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nalai Thread\", \"lines\": \"I carry the small cords, the ones that tie the daily bread to the daily name, and I have watched thin loops choke as surely as fat ropes when no one minded the lengths. If we do this, we must write margins into the braid where ordinary debts can breathe, and where a child’s mistake is not inherited by their grandchildren like a curse. The language of cord and ledger is exacting and cold, but it can be tuned, like a gate’s bearing, if we agree on the pitch. I can weave a clause that hears flood and famine as conditions, not as excuses, allowing temporary slack without letting the line slip from the boat and drown us. Let me lay the first knots to catch tears and sweat without drinking blood, and I will answer to any audit with clean hands and a clear throat.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tamsin Veil\", \"lines\": \"Couriers have carried truths through fire and through fog, and the only secrets that deserved to live were those that kept people breathing when gossip would have burned them. If this cord is to hold breath, then it must also hold message, because information is a tide and tides do not honor walls without preparation and respect. I will not let the Loom choke the messenger, nor the Kilns bribe the signal, nor the Wardens dam the rumor until it bursts and drowns us all. Write a lane for green flame, a truce path that no faction may toll, so that when the city must hear itself, it can, swiftly and without knives. Do this, and the Grey Lanterns will shutter their lamps to spell truths even stones can read, and lies will warp like cheap glass under a proper heat.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iriel Vask\", \"lines\": \"We do not pour breath into a treasury; we give the city lungs, and lungs do not hoard air, they move it, and music is the proof they are working. The cord will not tie us to a master if we tune it to a shared pitch, and that pitch lives where we hold back our cruelty and spend our strength with care. I can sound the Fourth-Rib bone flute and let the menhirs answer, their resonance mapping the safe knots where the breath will dwell without fraying the grammar of our names. We can braid margins into the weave, spaces that flex with flood and famine, that forgive without forgetting, that reckon without revenge. If we agree to be kinder with our strength and stingier with our cruelty, the breath will hold us to it like a song you cannot forget even when anger makes your hands shake for a blade.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Braid of Equals\", \"text\": \"Iriel proposes an accord that distributes voice and responsibility across all named factions present, committing the breath to a balanced braid that no single guild can tighten or slacken alone. They speak of a shared pitch verified at dawn and dusk by the Bone Bell’s silent sympathy, making abuse audible in the city’s very timbre so any citizen can hear it and cry foul. The plan builds in margins that flex during flood or famine, codified triggers that loosen or retie debts without drowning the poor or laundering the cruel. Oversight becomes a quartet, not a monolith: the Loom to count, the Third Rib to bless, the Nadiri to witness roads, and the Kilns to provision heat, all watched by a truce-lantern path for emergency messages. Iriel sets their bone flute against the Vessel’s lip and promises that the resonance maps will be made public in Sternum Plaza, so even those without chits may read how their city is breathing and hold it to account.\", \"outcome\": \"The stone soldiers incline their hollow faces, and the wind drops as if the steppe itself is listening to the new rhythm being written. Sereth bleeds a second measured line, and the hidden bell answers without sound, a pressure felt in teeth and truth, accepting the shared pitch. Leth Morrow binds the first loops with Nalai Thread’s careful knots, and Edris Thale fixes a blessing that forbids compulsion and sanctifies consent, while Safra scratches her bridge-mark beside a clause that preserves the road’s dignity. Avar Ir yields a tithe of heat to public works in lean months in exchange for transparent audits that prevent sabotage by jealousy, and Tamsin Veil inks the truce lane for green flame dispatch in times of civic strain. The breath pours like cool dawn into the unbraided city-cord in Sternum Plaza, and a faint hum rolls through the Seven Ribs; markets still their hands, gates take pressure like a song remembered, and the Accord of Living Flow is born under witness marks etched in bone-frost at first light.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"The Ledger’s Guard\", \"text\": \"Iriel advances a stricter weave that privileges clear accounting while fencing it with mercy, proposing that the Loom of Names hold the central knot under multiparty audit. They argue that fairness must be measurable or it will be devoured by eloquence, and that the city’s survival depends upon the integrity of cords no knife can casually cut. Margins for hardship are numerate and automatic, triggered by public weather and price indices recorded under oath at Sternum Plaza, preventing caprice from ruling compassion. The plan preserves caravan rights and funerary sanctity by making exceptions explicit and visible, so the exemptions cannot be hoarded by the well-connected. Iriel offers to etch resonance proofs in star-glass panels at the Scribehouse, where the city’s hum will alter the pattern whenever someone tries to twist the truth into profit.\", \"outcome\": \"Leth Morrow’s shoulders ease as if a weight he was born to carry finally finds a handle that fits his hand, and he speaks the grammar that binds numbers to mercy. Nalai Thread weaves allowances that expand like lungs when floods climb gates, with automatic re-tension when waters withdraw, and the menhirs’ hum approves the regularity. Edris Thale signs after Iriel inscribes a hard ban on name-commodities, denying all sales and collateralization of living identity, and Safra secures road clauses that translate ledgers into salt and song so caravans can read and comply. Avar Ir nods, agreeing to tie kiln quotas to transparent need, her pride mollified by strict audits that protect her workers from scapegoating during shortages. When the breath pours, the city’s name-cord takes on a crisp cadence, and the Seven Ribs resonate with a clean, counting lullaby that steadies markets, pacifies rumors, and earns a reluctant respect from rivals who find they cannot cheat without the stones themselves complaining.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Salt and Road\", \"text\": \"Iriel centers the accord on movement and mutual supply, proposing a braid that treats the city as a living portage rather than a hoard, with clauses that keep roads and canals breathing even under siege. They argue that a starving city counts nothing rightly and that a prosperous road diminishes none, so the breath must favor flow and reciprocity over stockpiles and suspicion. Toll ceilings adjust to scarcity signals, with caravan and barge captains bound to deliver staples before luxuries, and in return they receive guaranteed passage under lantern truce. The Loom keeps score in public, but the final authority to slow or speed tolls lies with a mixed road-court chaired by Safra Ninebridges, attended by the Third Rib and audited by the Kilns for practical provisioning. Iriel offers to tune the gates with star-glass forks at each season’s turn and publish the pressure songs in the Plaza, so the city can hear when it denies itself breath.\", \"outcome\": \"Safra Ninebridges writes her name with steady joy, and the bridgewomen who came with her hum a caravan harmony that the menhirs catch and reverberate. Leth Morrow marks safeguards so the flow cannot be hijacked by favorites, and Nalai Thread braids pledge-cords for captains that uncoil into penalties if staple deliveries fail. Edris Thale lays hands on the clauses that protect funerary processions and the unclaimed dead from being delayed by any toll, and Avar Ir claims a seat to guarantee kiln fuel allotments that keep the city’s heat lit without devouring its bones. The Riverwardens will grumble later, but for now the wind shifts as if a door has opened toward spring, and the Bone Bell’s silence feels like agreement rather than indifference. When the breath pours, the name-cord warms; markets sing softer, ferries move with fewer knives in their shadows, and the Accord receives witness marks from caravans whose songs will carry the news beyond the chalk step.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Temper at the Kiln\", \"text\": \"Iriel frames the accord around production tempered by conscience, proposing that the breath strengthen the city where it works, not where it hoards. They insist that heat must be yoked to health, that ash must be weighed alongside air, and that fires must answer to vows as much as to demand. Industrial quotas would flex with civic need measured aloud at the Bone-Market Arches, and in exchange the Kiln Syndicate accepts binding oversight by the Third Rib and open ledgers readable by apprentices and elders alike. The Loom administers clear caps on debt interest tied to output, forbidding any kiln or scribe from melting names into fuel for profit. Iriel pledges to publish resonance readings of furnace-songs in the Plaza, so that when greed tries to overfire the city, the very ribs of Marrowgate will ring wrong and summon a lawful cooling.\", \"outcome\": \"Avar Ir smiles like a hearth catching, not a wildfire racing, and she lays down a slag-bright token as collateral for the Syndicate’s good behavior under the Accord. Leth Morrow threads neat knots around the quotas, forbidding shadow work and ghost accounting, and Nalai builds relief valves that slow debt in drought without granting amnesty to the willfully cruel. Edris Thale approves upon reading firm bans against relic ash and clauses that route a portion of industrial heat to hospitals and shelters during cold snaps, making mercy automatic instead of optional. Safra secures priority transport for staple glass and tiles that keep roofs tight and aqueducts sealed, tying prosperity to public resilience rather than to private display. When the breath is poured, the city’s name-cord takes on a low, steady hum like a kiln at ideal temperature, and the Seven Ribs answer with a resonance that steadies hands at the furnaces and cools hot heads in council chambers.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C5\", \"title\": \"Vigil of the Third Rib\", \"text\": \"Iriel argues for a vow-forward accord that anchors all flow to dignity, placing funerary law and consent at the cord’s core so that prosperity cannot purchase permission to trespass the dead or the living. They declare that a city that keeps its dead in honor keeps its living in hope, and that hope is a sturdier scaffolding than fear disguised as order. Debt forgiveness becomes ritualized and witnessed, granted in cycles that remove inherited curses while preserving accountability for harm freely chosen. The Loom will count, but the Third Rib will close the book on those who have paid, banning forever the sale of any name or its fraction under any pretext. Iriel commits to lodge resonance proofs at the Cathedral and the Scribehouse both, so that sacred and secular conscience share a mirror and cannot pretend not to see what the other sees.\", \"outcome\": \"Edris Thale’s blessing rises like smoke from wet cedar and settles on the circle as a gravity that the menhirs respect, and the stone soldiers turn their faces toward the Cathedral as if recognizing an elder. Leth Morrow signs with sober clarity, acknowledging that the Loom must serve the living law rather than pretend to be it, and Nalai Thread ties bright markers that signal public forgiveness days. Safra secures protections for travelers who die on the road, ensuring swift rites and safe conveyance without predation by toll or by rumor. Avar Ir concedes ash allocations in perpetuity for reliquary upkeep and plague warding, a tithe taken not as punishment but as participation in the city’s promise to itself.
