Dust motes drift on that breath as if each grain carries a vow, and the lamplight catches the scrimshawed edges of bone tiles that line the aisles like carefully solved proofs. She lays out anxious notes in a neat fan, ink still wet, describing a growing disharmony between the Cathedral of the Third Rib’s funerary wards and the First Rib Sluiceworks’ pressure cadence, as if oath and water had started walking with different feet across the same perilous bridge. The city, she says, is carrying a hidden strain, a stress line running from prayer to gate, and only someone who can hear both bone and promise might map it before it staves in and drowns every ledger under a single wrong chord. She bids Iriel to take the fourth-rib bone flute and the resonant star-glass forks into the city’s breath, listening at dawn and dusk where the hum is honest, to mark any frost-script that appears on the Sternum Plaza tiles when their lanterns gutter like spent lungs. When the Collegium bells toll again, the notes are soothing as lullabies to anxious apprentices, yet the ribs above reply with a sour undertone, and Lysa’s gaze lingers on the bone beads braided in Iriel’s black hair as though counting each for luck. Beneath the mentor’s steady professionalism is real fear that the city’s old song is slipping, that the wyrm’s skeleton remembers a war the living have forgotten, and that the wrong whisper at the wrong tile might turn treaty-tallies into epitaphs. She ends with a whisper that sounds less like an order than a plea, saying that if the city can still be tuned, its tuning fork must walk on two careful feet and carry a green light through places that do not echo.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Sound the Fourth-Rib Bone Flute at dawn beneath the Cathedral of the Third Rib and record harmonic deviations.\",\n        \"Use the Resonant Star-Glass Forks to test gate cadence at the First Rib Sluiceworks with Suri Yal’s supervision.\",\n        \"Visit Sternum Plaza at dusk and check the central inlay for frost-script whispers related to flow or oaths.\",\n        \"Report findings to Lysa Truin at the Pale Collegium.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lysa Truin\", \"lines\": \"The city is an instrument, Iriel, and of late it will not hold tune, no matter how gently we coax the strings of bone and ledger. The reliquary wards sustain a low C of consolation, yet the sluice gates throb in a fretful F that grates the teeth and sets the oath-cords quivering in their frames like frightened harp strings. I have listened from archive galleries and from the back steps of the Collegium kitchens, and the same sourness hides in every echo that returns to me. Go where oaths and water meet, listen with care at dawn and at dusk when truth is least shy, and bring me not just measurements but the shape of the hurt your marrow hears between them. If the ribs begin to creak against each other, the Seven Ribs will not hold us long, and all our clever arguments will become mere breath lost over the River of No Echo. Take the flute, test with the forks, and write on bone or on your own palm if you must, but do not let the city’s song drift without a witness. And if you feel the old taboos tug at your sleeve, remember we honor them best by preventing the need to break them.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iriel Vask\", \"lines\": \"I’ll follow the hum from altar to gate and mark any seam where it slips, and I will walk slow enough to hear the footfalls between the notes. The flute still answers the ribs if I breathe with the bell, and the forks sing true when glass is honest and when a lie is trying to wear a vow’s clothes. If there is a fracture line between prayer and pressure, I’ll trace it with chalk and patience until its edges admit what they mean to cut. I’ll kneel at the Plaza as the lanterns gutter and read whatever frost dares to write my name, and I’ll do it softly so gossip comes to me as a friend and not as a mob. If I hear anything with teeth, I’ll step carefully, set a green shutter for truce, and send word before I take the next step into its mouth. And when the listening is done, I will come back with more than numbers, because numbers alone never kept water behind a gate nor grief inside an oath.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Suri Yal\", \"lines\": \"You can have my watch at the crown of Gate Three at dusk, scholar, but touch the bearings only when I say and keep your sermons out of my pressure charts unless you plan to take a wrench as your scripture. The river’s silence hears our names when the water runs fast, and it mislikes scholars more than I do, because you all name things too loudly and the No Echo loves to take names as payment. Hum your notes, tap your forks, and if the song goes wrong we close the gates and blame the wind until the Council finds a different fiction it likes better. I remember the day you tuned the bearings with those star-glass shims and kept us from swallowing a barge whole, so I’ll trust your ears so long as they remember they are guests down here. If my crews grow jumpy, you will stand where I tell you and count breaths with me until the surge passes, because panic is the only flood we can guarantee. And if your frost-script at the Plaza writes me into a mess, you will bring me the first reading, not the secondhand rumor sold at Fifth Rib prices.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Brother Halin\", \"lines\": \"Sternum Plaza is neutral ground so long as the oaths hold, and some days I swear I can hear them creak like tired rigging when the wind shifts. If frost takes your whisper, know that it bites truth as easily as gossip, and it marks those named whether they wish it or not, so speak with the mercy you would hope for if your own ledger were laid bare. Kneel at the central inlay when the lanterns gutter, and keep your voice between your teeth, or you’ll have every debt-singer in the Fifth Rib reading your breath at dawn and bidding on it by noon. The tiles feel coldest when a lie is walking toward them, and tonight the cold is in my bones, so I advise a clean word and a clean exit. We keep the peace here with the patience of old bones, and we will keep it for you, so long as you remember that even a whisper can carry like a bell if the night is still enough.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Swear the Work Publicly at the Cathedral\", \"text\": \"You ascend the incense-bright nave of the Cathedral of the Third Rib before dawn and request a formal witnessing from Prior Edris Thale, placing your bone flute, star-glass forks, and satchel on the Warden’s Altar like instruments upon a surgeon’s tray. You speak at length of harmonics and of the duty to tune rather than to break, and you ask that the Order’s wardens accompany your steps as ethical ballast. You petition for a light blessing upon your breath so that frost-script will take only the words you mean and not the fear beneath them, and you agree to recite the Accords of Quiet Dust before any test that threatens to stir remnants. The Prior listens, argues, and finally nods, and you feel the Cathedral’s ribs answer with a low approval, as if the city itself had listened to your courtesy. You leave marked with a thin ash-sign across your brow, watched by candlelight and the steady regard of names carved along the Long Shelf of the unclaimed dead, and your own name feels heavier but safer for having been witnessed. You walk out into the blue-hour with the sense that you carry not only tools but also a covenant, and that the covenant will ask for patience when hurry claws at your heels.\", \"outcome\": \"Your work proceeds slower under the eyes of wardens and their careful rituals, but each reading carries the weight of accepted practice and cannot be easily denounced by rival guilds. At the Sluiceworks, Suri Yal grumbles at the ceremony but finds comfort in the way the warding cords steady the crews, and the bearings seem to sing more cleanly when the Order’s bell tone threads through the clatter. At Sternum Plaza, your whisper manifests as a clean band of frost that names only flows and oaths, not people, and Brother Halin quietly thanks you for keeping gossip hungry and thin. Lysa receives your notes with visible relief, noting that the deviations align across sacred and civic measures, and she underlines passages with a finger that trembles less than before. Some in the Ember Kiln Syndicate mutter that you have invited priests into matters of industry, but their complaints find little traction against the Order’s ledger of witness. You keep all promised rewards intact, and you gain a reputation for probity that will make some doors open on their hinges rather than on their locks.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Run a Grey Lantern Shadow Route\", \"text\": \"You slip from the Collegium by a side stair at lantern-dim and let your green-shutter light blink once toward Phosphor House, calling a truce-sign that only reflections know how to read. Within the tower, First Wick Tamsin Veil hears you out with a smile like a narrow bridge and offers routes that curl through the underways where rumor can be taught to walk in circles. Cor Yune lays a map on a pane of star-glass and traces the city’s rib-harmonics as if they were a contraband melody, promising that shutters and whispers will pinch closed behind you and keep Riverwarden eyes from prying. You make your tests between breaths and between shifts, reading gate-song when crews turn and frost-script when crowds thin, and you write your notes in ink that fades at a spoken word only you and the Lanterns share. There is risk in this: the No Echo likes to swallow names that walk without witnesses, and your own name carries a lien you would prefer to keep quiet, but the Grey Lanterns thrive on such balances and promise to hold the other end of your cord. When you return to the tower at dawn, the city seems a fraction more legible, like a cipher you have taught your tongue to taste rather than to break with a hammer.\", \"outcome\": \"Your measurements are sharp and unhindered by ritual delays, but your presence at the gates and the Plaza is later rumored in the Riverwardens’ ranks as a shadow that smelt of green light, and you will have to answer the curl of Jull Nerr’s eyebrow on some future day. The data you gather shows the same disharmony Lysa feared, painted in quick strokes and hidden notations that only a handful of Grey Lantern tutors could read without your guidance. Suri Yal pretends not to see you the first night and then mutters that the wind must be full of scholars, yet she fixes a bearing angle you suggest with a wrench-turn that acknowledges your ear. At the Plaza your frost-whisper lines are delicate, almost invisible to those without the trick of the Lanterns’ glass, and Brother Halin is both impressed and unsettled that truth can be made this quiet. Lysa thanks you with a clasp of both hands and murmurs that sometimes the right path is the one that leaves the least footprint, but she warns you that the Loom of Names will not miss the smell of Grey Lantern ink on your notes forever. You keep all promised rewards intact, and you pocket a soft favor from Phosphor House that will glow when next you need a rumor to forget where it was going.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Tune the Gates in the Moment\", \"text\": \"You ask Suri Yal for a narrow window at shift-change and propose a live micro-tune, setting one fork to the reliquary’s consoling C and another to the sluice’s fretful F until their beat-note writes its invisible pulse in your bones. With Suri’s scowl for courage, you brace on the crown of Gate Three and breathe through the bone flute so softly that only the gate’s oldest bolts might hear you, shaping the tone to coax the misaligned cadence into meeting you halfway. You whisper counts with the crew, time your tap to the moment the river pauses between insistences, and feel the metal listen with a grudging patience. The gate answers with a tremor that is not fear but memory, and you taste iron and old prayer as if a cathedral had leaned down to drink from the river and left a drop in your mouth. The risk is neither small nor theatrical: a wrong pitch could turn pressure cruel and drag a worker under or crack a bearing for a season, but sometimes a city demands courage expressed as skill and not as speeches. When the tremor settles, the throbbing F softens a half-step, and you know you have stolen a mouthful of disharmony and taught it the beginning of a better word.\", \"outcome\": \"The immediate cadence improves just enough that the crews feel the change as confidence in their hands, and Suri calls you by your first name without the armor of sarcasm for the first time. Your notes record a living response from the gates, a small but vivid proof that the city’s bone and iron will answer gentle correction before they require surgery, and Lysa circles these passages so hard the ink nearly pierces the page. At the Plaza, your frost-script seems to echo the adjustment with a line that curls like a softened gear tooth, and Brother Halin remarks that sometimes the best prayer is a well-timed breath. The Riverwardens file no complaint because nothing broke and because crews who sleep easier make fewer mistakes, though a few older hands spit for luck and ask you not to make a habit of music near their wages. Rival guild whispers insist you played games with taboos, but the Order hears your account and grudgingly acknowledges that no remnant stirred and no oath was bruised. You keep all promised rewards intact, and you gain a quiet rumor that when you listen, gates listen back, which is the kind of story that can save a life at the edge of a flood.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Experience\", \"description\": \"200 experience for mapping and mediating the city’s strained harmonics without breaking taboo.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Items\", \"description\": \"Collegium Letter of Field Study attesting to licensed investigation, and a Bottle of Bone Ink suited for recording frost-script and oath-tunes.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Currency\", \"description\": \"12 chits in matched scrimshawed slivers, ledger-true to the Loom of Names.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Pale Collegium reputation +2 for scholarly service; Order of the Third Rib reputation +1 for respectful practice at sacred sites.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
