Kiln-Queen Avar Ir summons Iriel Vask across catwalks etched with heat runes, proposing a lens unlike any ledger has dared: singglass, tempered not by the River of No Echo’s smothering hush but by the breath taken from the Glass Choir in the Silica Reef. The Reef lies three days northwest, a forest of transparent pillars that sing when a truthful lie is spoken beneath their boughs, and its harmonies can anneal what even star-metal strains. Grey Lantern oversight is demanded to keep rumor honest and risk accounted, so Cor Yune joins with green shutters and a courier’s steadiness while Fire Marshal Dako Fen shadows the expedition with a brace of kiln loyalists, wary that the Lanterns intend a spectacle to shame the Syndicate. The Choir will not exhale for mere bravado; it demands a paradox placed like a blade on the tongue, something true in consequence and false in form, or false in form and true in consequence, held at dusk when the spires catch the last note and the map of harmonics rearranges in Iriel’s hands. Between shattering squalls and the Choir’s cutting hymns, the party must defuse the slow-boiling feud between Syndicate fire and Lantern shade, for bloodshed would splinter the grove and sour the breath. Should the Choir be moved to open its invisible lungs and the breath be bottled without fracture, the return to Ember Kilnworks will birth a lens that reads the discord between star-metal and bone and shows where harmony may be coaxed before gates scream and bones crack.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Travel to the Silica Reef with Avar Ir and Cor Yune and locate the Glass Choir.\",\n        \"Speak a truthful lie beneath the spires to coax their breath without shattering the grove.\",\n        \"Defuse the confrontation between Dako Fen’s kiln loyalists and Cor Yune without bloodshed.\",\n        \"Capture the Choir’s breath and return to Ember Kilnworks to craft the singglass lens.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Avar Ir\", \"lines\": \"You think us brutish, all scorch and slag, but the first glass was a prayer that could be held, a cooled hymn cupped in a mortal hand. Bone remembers pressure and debt; glass remembers heat and the moment it chose to forgive the sand, and that forgiveness can make a city live through seasons that would have killed it. I will make you a lens that sings with bone and does not lie to water, a sheeted truth-fire that shows where star-metal bites too deep and where marrow must refuse the wound. In exchange, I ask not for kneeling, but for an end to the habit of apology—for stopgaps to priests and scribes who would smother every spark in soot and scripture. We can save the city and prosper doing it, if we stop asking stones and bones for permission to be warm and start asking them for partnership in the making.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Cor Yune\", \"lines\": \"I carry shutters that say truth in green and secrets in gray, and I have watched both save lives and set them alight. If the Choir listens for a paradox, it will punish theater as harshly as malice, so we must mean the cut we place upon our tongues and keep our breath steady as if balancing on canal ice. I will watch the kiln’s hands and the shape of their lies, and I will count how many times we save each other from our better angels, because the worst disasters in this city are born from virtues driven past their rightful pitch. The spires answer to consequence and intent, not lilt alone; if we bring spite into their forest, they will mirror it back as shards aimed for the throat. Let us go with a promise of restraint, a flask for the Choir’s breath, and a pact that whatever truth we bend we will set straight before the next moonrise.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iriel Vask\", \"lines\": \"I will say this beneath those singing boughs: the city does not need the river. It is a lie in form, because we would starve in a week and dry to shell in a month, yet it is true in consequence, because the river is not a need but a covenant, and we can choose to honor it better than we have. If we treat water as a master it will drown us in our fear; if we treat it as a partner it will carry us when the world leans. Hear that, Choir, and cut the difference into me if you must, but give us your breath so we can see the harm we are doing before it breaks our teeth and the ribs that shelter us. I will hold the Resonance Map to dusk’s last note, and I will listen until my bones hum with your verdict and my glass scar sings its answering sting.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Dako Fen\", \"lines\": \"You Lanterns will write a tragedy on slag and call it a safety report, and then sell tickets in whispers until the city thinks it authored itself. I have seen men and women breathe the kiln’s poison for their children to eat, and I will not have my Queen’s work pinned like a burned moth to your rumor board. You say truce and mean theater; you say oversight and mean ownership; but hear this—if this lens cracks under a priest’s sigh or a scribe’s audit, I will pour it back into your mouths and teach you how to anneal your words until they ring true. I stand here because the Syndicate has more to lose than a headline: furnaces cooled too fast seize and never burn right again, and a worker cooled too fast never warms to trust. Earn my respect by putting your hands where your claims are, and I will keep my people’s tempers banked like coals until the glass decides which of us is lying.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Speak the River Covenant Paradox\", \"text\": \"Iriel steps beneath the tallest spire and raises the Resonance Map, letting dusk ladder the glass with rose and ash as the Fourth-Rib flute hums a quiet drone. In a voice measured like a lockkeeper counting surges, Iriel declares, The city does not need the river, and explains the covenant that turns necessity into chosen duty until the sentence becomes a bridge that can bear weight. Cor Yune shutters a green truce behind Iriel’s shoulder, each flick of the plates a promise that the words are meant to heal, not humiliate, and that no tally will be kept beyond life and safety. Avar Ir unbinds the anneal cords on a waiting flask while Dako Fen restrains his loyalists with a lifted palm, pride fighting prudence and losing to the tinder-bright glint in the spire’s edge. The Choir answers with a harmony that tightens the ribs of those listening and loosens the throat, and for a breathless moment it seems as if the forest itself inhales through Iriel’s words.\", \"outcome\": \"The spires exhale in unison, a wind that does not move dust but presses lightly on the skin as if testing for a fever, and the flask warms with captured, invisible breath. Dako Fen releases a long-held sigh and nods once to Cor Yune, who acknowledges with a minimal, almost ceremonial tilt, and the loyalists settle as if a pressure surge has passed without rupturing the gate. Avar Ir smiles without baring teeth and says nothing, but her hands are steady as she seals the flask, and her eyes hold Iriel’s for the count of three oaths. On the path back through the glass-bloom paths, the party shares canteens and silence rather than victories, and even the wind seems to hum in a gentler key. When the lens is later cast and quenched in Choir breath, it sings a thin, true tone; disagreements remain, but they have been tuned down from blades to tools.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Name the Wyrm’s Vigil: False in Mouth, True in Fate\", \"text\": \"Iriel chooses a different paradox and speaks softly, The wyrm is dead and listening, letting the lie of form and the promise of consequence braid together like knotted ash-cords. The phrase is repeated in three pitches—bone, glass, and breath—so the Choir hears intention stitched to craft, and the forest’s high branches begin to tremble as though remembering a storm. Cor Yune assigns tasks rather than arguments: Dako Fen is asked to hold the capture flask steady, his hands judged by heat and discipline, while Avar Ir times the pour by the Choir’s harmonics so that pride becomes participation. The loyalists, seeing their marshal enlisted rather than opposed, relax their shoulders, and the Lantern shutters spell a silent pact along the path of reflections that only the spires can read. When the final word leaves Iriel’s mouth, it feels like stepping from a ledger line into a river current that has decided to be kind today.\", \"outcome\": \"The Choir exhales in pulses, each gust a measure of consequence tuned to the vow, and a hairline crack blooms on a distant spire like frost writing its own cartography. Dako Fen holds firm, taking the breath without spilling, and his jaw unclenches as the flask seals, his loyalty briefly warmed by being needed rather than policed. Cor Yune marks the cracked spire in a pocket ledger with a promise to return, not as evidence but as a responsibility, and the green shutters close like eyelids ending a watch. On the return trail, a shattering squall rises and breaks harmlessly around the group, as if the Reef itself declines to cut those who kept faith with paradox. The lens later takes the breath cleanly, and while a single Choir pillar bears a new scar, the city inherits a tool that teaches repair over spectacle.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Let the Queen Speak, Guide the Note\", \"text\": \"Iriel turns to Avar Ir and says that a queen who commands fire should place the paradox herself, but offers to tune the pitch so the Choir hears craft rather than dominion. Avar hesitates, pride and prudence crossing blades, and then nods, accepting the burden while Iriel sounds the Fourth-Rib flute and maps the spires’ standing tones like a healer locating a pulse. Cor Yune raises a green shutter to call truce and a gray shutter to swallow gossip, and invites Dako Fen to witness up close so no rumor can accuse the Syndicate of hiding its breath behind a courier’s cloak. The Kiln-Queen speaks, The river obeys us when we bow to it, a sentence bent like a stoked bar until its form rings false and its consequence rings true, and the Reef listens as if choosing whether to cut or cradle. Iriel catches the harmonics on the Resonance Map, guiding the word’s heat away from splintering pitches and into a slope the spires can bear.\", \"outcome\": \"The Choir exhales warily, like a creature smelling past injury and finding a new scent of restraint, and the flask fills with a breath that tastes faintly of rain on slag. Dako Fen murmurs that a queen who can be corrected is a fire that will not run wild, and in that quiet concession the loyalists’ tempers gutter down to embers. Cor Yune seals the shutters with a final green blink that reads, Pact Kept, and the forest’s song fades without a shard falling to mark dissent. On the march home, Avar Ir admits, in a voice for the road and not the council, that the Lanterns did not shame her craft so much as steady it, while Iriel shares a sliver of their own name-obligation to show the price of guidance. The lens receives the Choir’s breath as if it recognizes its maker’s humility, and in Ember Kilnworks the finished singglass shows star-metal stress like frost mapping a window, teaching cooperation without demanding anyone kneel.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M8\"], \"next\": [\"M10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"experience\", \"description\": \"700 experience for navigating the Silica Reef, shaping paradox into harmony, and returning with the Choir’s breath.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Singglass Resonance Lens, a tempered pane that reveals the dissonance between star-metal and bone without lying to water.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Ember-Kiln Anneal Charm, a kiln-blessed token that steadies craft and temper in heat and argument alike.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"currency\", \"description\": \"30 chits, scrimshawed and matched to Loom of Names ledgers for materials, passage fees, and goodwill offerings.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Ember Kiln Syndicate reputation increased by 2 for honoring the Kiln-Queen’s design and bringing the Choir’s breath without shaming the craft.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Grey Lanterns reputation increased by 1 for keeping truce, truth, and outcomes aligned under watchful shutters.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
