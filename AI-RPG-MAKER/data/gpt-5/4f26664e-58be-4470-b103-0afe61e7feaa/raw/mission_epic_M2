Gate Three shudders with a halting tremor, as if a heart had forgotten its next beat, then steadies with a stubborn hush that makes the marrow ache. Lanterns along the tower flare once and gutter, their tongues greening and then dimming as pressure whispers along oath-bound bearings that should sing true. Suri Yal stands above the wheel with knuckles chalked white, the set of her shoulders a brace against the unseen current, and she snarls a prayer to old bolts that saved the city before and will not fail while her breath is worth heat. When your resonant star-glass fork shivers, it reveals a pale thread of cold brightness in the bearing—an overtone thin and bright as shardstorm wind—that does not belong to river or city. With calipers, bone chalk, and the soft hum of a Fourth Rib pitch, the bearing yields a splintered prize: shard-thin fragments of star-glass etched in shutter lines like a lamp is trying to speak through glass instead of night, every edge cutting at rhythm and intention. As you palm the wrapped splinters, Harbormaster Jull Nerr’s boots drum up the spiral, each step a verdict; his river-shadow falls across the gear teeth as he demands chain of custody, seal, and ledger of who dared teach his gate to hesitate. Suri’s glance, exhausted and defiant, meets yours for the space of a hum, and in that held beat she asks what a Riverwarden cannot: take this rumor where rumor is fed and disciplined, to the Grey Lanterns’ Phosphor House whose shutters speak truths that ears cannot carry. The city’s ribs creak as if remembering a promise, and far above, the Skull Keep’s lanterns blink in the skull’s eyes like distant counsel; somewhere, in the Seventh Rib’s shadowed alleys, shutters fold and unfold, and codes breathe in green light.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Stabilize Gate Three’s bearing with Suri Yal by identifying and extracting the discordant star-glass splinters without violating the Riverwardens’ safety rites.\",\n        \"Examine the etchings on the splinters under your green-shutter lantern and carefully copy the shutter code into your pocket ledger with exact strokes.\",\n        \"Decide whether to place the splinters directly into Harbormaster Jull Nerr’s custody or to smuggle a precise rubbing to Phosphor House for clandestine decoding.\",\n        \"Consult First Wick Tamsin Veil at Phosphor House about the shutter code’s origin, intent, and the hand—or faction—that set it humming inside the gate.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Suri Yal\", \"lines\": \"There—feel that stall in the wheel as the teeth taste silence and refuse to chew it? It’s like someone taught the bearing to hold its breath and then rewarded it for disobedience with a cold sweet, the kind you only find under shard glass after a storm. Ease the fork there, no, there, and hum the low pitch so the metal remembers it belongs to the city and not to the sky that fell west of here. I told Jull we needed a clean run to second lantern, and now the river sits like an insult and the gauges tick the way a liar blinks too fast. If that’s star-glass in my gate, I’ll make the Kiln Syndicate drink their slag, but if it’s a shutter code carved for mischief, I want a name to bolt to this wheel so that every turn hammers it into the ledger of the guilty. Hold steady, Iriel—when it yields, it will try to cut the song out of our throats, and I intend to be singing when this city needs a tune.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jull Nerr\", \"lines\": \"I don’t care what the Collegium says it hears, and I care even less for folk who bring star-words into my locks; what I care about is that my gate hesitated and a Nadiri keel near drowned in the pressure rebound like a calf under first ice. I want those shards sealed, logged, and put under Harbor House lock with a warden’s ash-mark across the cord, and I want it before the next bell, not after your theories finish polishing themselves. And you, Vask—your passes are as thin as your excuses and twice as easy to tear, so mind your step and your tone in my tower while the river has no voice to plead for you. One unsanctioned whisper to your lamp-friends and I’ll have you counting gulls from the outer booms until your bones learn the difference between wind and duty. We do not play at secrets where bearing-bones turn, and if a shutter code touched my gate, I’ll find the hand that angled it and teach it to feel what a gate feels when it is held wrong.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iriel Vask\", \"lines\": \"The splinters hum in patterns I’ve only heard where signals live, in the green-washed blink of shutters and the hush of courier stairs, and that makes this not an accident but a sentence carved where machines should not read. The river stayed its voice long enough for someone to thread this in, and it isn’t a dockside prank because pranks don’t carry harmonics that know our lock cadence and tempt the teeth to forget their oath. If I carry a faithful copy to the Grey Lanterns, I can bring back the truth of the code and the hand that etched it, and then the council can argue with facts instead of fears. The gate will hold because you held it, Suri, and because Jull set his boots on the stair like a verdict, so let me hold the rumor it’s choking on and see if rumor will yield to the green flame that names what it touches. My forks will keep watch on the bearing, my flute will keep the Fourth Rib tone in the metal’s memory, and my ledger will not sleep until we have a name to hang from this wheel.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tamsin Veil\", \"lines\": \"I can smell the shard dust on your ledger even before the green shutter answers, and that tells me two things: the river nearly swallowed a lie, and someone thought we would not taste the grit in our own bread. This etching rides our speech like a counterfeit mask—close enough to pass in a storm, but wrong at the corners where a true Lantern leaves gentled space for mercy and for mistake. Whoever carved this wanted to teach the gate to hesitate on the beat that signals ‘truce’ in green, and if you had not pulled it free, a night of rain would have turned that kindness into a choke. Phosphor House does not deny the code’s family, but I tell you as First Wick that no hand sworn to our lamp cut these angles, because a Lantern’s knife learns to round where this one bristled like spite. Take this back to your Harbormaster with my seal on the rubbing and tell him our shutters will blink in witness, and whisper to Suri that the glass carries a heat pattern like the Ember Kilnworks’ second shelf—too hot by a breath—so their slag may have sung the blank before a traitor taught it words.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Surrender the splinters to Jull Nerr under full seal\", \"text\": \"You stand your ground on the lock tower stones and choose the path of naked ledger and public custody, lifting the wrapped splinters like a confession presented without bargaining. You speak of duty in Jull’s language, of cords and seals and the quiet pride of a gate that answers only to the city and to the river that has no echo and thus cannot be bribed by applause. You describe the rubbing you have kept in your pocket ledger with care and promise that your copy will labor for the same end: to name the hand and mend the harm without cloaks or masks. Suri’s jaw tightens, but she nods to the rhythm of rules she has lived by, and her eyes say she will hold the line while politics make a meal of blame. The Grey Lanterns will not love that you denied them first taste, but even a courier knows some truths must pass beneath the open sky where everyone can see them without shutters.\", \"outcome\": \"Jull Nerr takes the evidence with a warden’s cord and marks it in ash with a solemnity that turns his suspicion into temporary shelter, and he grants you a Harbor House day-pass to continue supervised tests on the bearing until second lantern. The Riverwardens’ respect for your obedience rises like pressure in a well-kept gauge, and murmurs along the First Rib soften when your name is spoken, even if the words are not sweet. Tamsin Veil reads your rubbing by reflection and gives you a measured nod, but her shutters stay half-lidded in future meetings until you prove that open custody did not strangle the truth. In the short run the gate steadies, a Nadiri keel glides through without a tremor, and Jull promises extra eyes on the Ember Kilnworks slag trains; in the long run you will find a door opened in Skull Keep that was shut to you before. When M3 arrives, you bear the Harbor House seal like a lantern against fog, and the city answers your petitions a heartbeat quicker than it once did.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Smuggle a perfect rubbing to Phosphor House beneath green light\", \"text\": \"You wrap the rubbing in oiled vellum, tuck it beneath the false spine of your ledger, and drift into the underways where whisper-tubes breathe and walls remember footsteps by temperature rather than sound. Suri turns the wheel just so and lets a chorus of harmless clanks cover your exit, proving again that trust is a tune two people can keep even when the river is trying to steal the beat. You climb Phosphor House’s shadowed stairs, knock in the lantern cadence that promises truce, and let the shutters spell welcome on your cheeks in a reflection only you can read. Tamsin’s eyes take the writing from the rubbing and write patience back into your bones, and Cor Yune’s ink fingers flutter like wings over a map of the city’s rumor routes. You leave with a promise that truth will wear a mask only long enough to survive the next bell, and that the mask will be yours to lift in the right room, at the right time, with a green flame that makes liars blink.\", \"outcome\": \"The Grey Lanterns’ regard brightens; messages move for you with fewer tolls and the shutters of Phosphor House will answer a soft knock even on off-bells, and Tamsin entrusts you with a clue: the cut angles favor a hand trained near the Ember Kilnworks’ annealers. Jull’s jaw grinds when he learns you carried rumor into a rumor house, and while he cannot strip your pass after Suri’s testimony, he does count your steps twice when you climb the tower. Suri defends you in Riverwarden circles with a weary certainty that you chose the right tool for a code that was born in shadow, and her trust firms into a plank you can tread in a storm. The gate holds, the Day-Pass still finds your palm, and your ledger gains a private annotation on shutter drift that will open a quiet archive door in M3. When the next mission stirs, you carry not just a pass but a phrase in lantern cant that will unseal a testimony only the green knows how to keep alive.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Decode the splinters alone by the wheel’s hush\", \"text\": \"You set your star-glass forks around the bearing in a careful triangle and breathe the Fourth Rib note until the metal remembers the shape of obedience without leaning on anyone’s shutter or seal. The green-shutter lantern hangs hooded, just enough glow to wake the frost-script on your ledger, and you let the splinters answer you by stress and by tremor as if they were bones under a surgeon’s hand. Each etched angle reveals a cadence almost-kind, a mimicry of the truce blink that loses its mercy at the margins, and you write the difference as a fragment of a psalm no priest has heard. The river presses once as if to ask whether your arrogance weighs more than its silence, and you answer with chalk and patience and an old habit of listening to stones. When footsteps sound above, you have a translation that limps but moves, and you fold it into the ledger with ink that dries the color of resolve.\", \"outcome\": \"Your partial decoding is good enough to spot the mimicry and to guess a kiln-born hand, and when you bring it to both Harbormaster and First Wick you own the surprise and the risk in equal measure. Jull scolds you for courting a surge without a second set of hands, but he cannot help the grudging nod he gives your work, and he allows your Harbor House day-pass to stand under Suri’s guardianship. Tamsin corrects your edges with a teacher’s gentleness and a spy’s steel, and she adds a gloss that ties the cuts to the Ember Kilnworks’ second shelf while marking one flourish as a counterfeit meant to frame a rival. You win time but lose some ready trust; both factions watch you more closely, which in Marrowgate is a kind of armor as well as a leash. In M3 you arrive with a flawed map that still shows the road, and the city’s next decision will hinge on whether you have learned that some codes want a chorus, not a soloist.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M1\"], \"next\": [\"M3\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Experience\", \"description\": \"Earn 300 experience for diagnosing the gate’s false song, extracting the star-glass splinters without harm, and pursuing the shutter code’s origin.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Star-Glass Splinter (Encoded): a wrapped shard etched with the counterfeit truce blink, retaining trace resonance useful for later decoding and evidence.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Harbor House Day-Pass: stamped leave to access Gate Three’s tower and bearings under Riverwarden oversight through the next bell-cycle.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Currency\", \"description\": \"18 chits in scrimshawed slivers matched to Loom of Names ledgers, sufficient to grease tolls and quiet doors during the investigation.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Riverwardens of the No Echo +1: respect for stabilizing Gate Three and honoring the lock’s chain of custody in spirit if not always in letter.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Grey Lanterns +1: favor for carrying the code in good faith and seeking Phosphor House counsel on the shutter-etching’s origin.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
