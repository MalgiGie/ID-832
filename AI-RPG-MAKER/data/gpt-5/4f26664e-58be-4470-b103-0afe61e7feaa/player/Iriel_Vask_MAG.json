        "description": "Lean and lantern-pale from long nights in archives and underways; coal-black hair braided with thin bone beads; steady grey eyes that reflect lamplight with a faint green sheen from years reading star-glass.",

    "history": "Born rope-bridge side in the Seventh Rib to a ledger-runner and a kiln tally-clerk, Iriel Vask learned early that Marrowgate breathes in oaths and pumps through gates. A knack for resonance led to apprenticeship at the Pale Collegium, where Archivist Lysa Truin noticed that Iriel could hear when bone and promise were out of tune. Under Lysa's guidance, Iriel mapped echo-lines between the Cathedral of the Third Rib and the Sluiceworks, showing how oath-hum rode canal pressure. When a silent surge threatened the First Rib gates, Gatewright Suri Yal brought Iriel below the lock crowns to listen; together they tuned the bearings with star-glass shims and stopped a collapse. That success earned a standing canal pass and a permanent frown from Harbormaster Jull Nerr, who mistrusts scholars meddling with his river. Iriel's research now skirts city taboos: a bone flute tuned to the Fourth Rib has answered the Cartographer's Needle, and maps in Iriel's care sometimes redraw themselves at dusk. A restricted descent at the Wyrmwell, arranged off-ledger with Suri, nearly ended in disaster when the cartilage gate sang back. Jull Nerr hauled them out by militia order and would have revoked all passes if Lysa had not vouched that the work might save the city in a true flood. Since then, Iriel works between Collegium lecture halls, the Sluiceworks' thunder, and lantern-dim alleys where rumors run faster than water, trying to keep bone, glass, and name in tune while the Seven Ribs creak with old arguments.",
