    "description": "The Scribehouse of the Loom of Names breathed a cool hush like the inside of a shell, cords swaying in faint drafts as if they were the city’s own pale lungs drawing and releasing secret air. Iriel Vask’s green-shutter lantern guttered as it entered, its light caught and gentled by inkstone screens, the scent of bone ash and iron gall whispering of oaths made legible and debts taught to march in orderly lines. Archivist Leth Morrow met that light with a gaze weighted by ledgers no arm could lift, his irises the dry glint of a sealknife, measuring not only Iriel’s request but the seam-stress in their voice and the echo of the River of No Echo in the rasp of their breath. In a room where names were braided into value and value could outlive blood, Leth spoke of a frost-script whisper that had bloomed at dawn upon Sternum Plaza, a phrase thin as breath and sharp as winter, naming the Loom as guarantor of a clandestine descent at the Wyrmwell where cartilage sang like a locked throat. He wanted the whisper whole, every word and curl of vapor, and he wanted the identity of the breath that made it without that name being pushed into public air, ostensibly to correct a ledger whose figures had started to blur at the edges when the ribs of the city creaked. As counterweight he produced a temporary writ, the parchment quivering as if eager to be bound, sanctioning Iriel’s approach to the Cartographer’s Needle at dusk or dawn, and he named his junior, Nalai Thread, as escort and witness so that any future inquest would have more than rumor to chew. The bargain hummed in Iriel’s chest like a fork struck true: a secret fetched for a key, a key exchanged for visibility, and visibility exchanged for risk in a city where taboos on bearing-bones and sold names were as real as gates and teeth. Beyond the Scribehouse waited Sternum Plaza’s cold tiles, where whispers frost themselves into legible breath at first light, and beyond that the basalt flats, whose geometry slid underfoot as if maps were ideas rather than roads, where stone-sprites stole direction and the Needle itself redrew borders to the rhythm of ribs. Between those measures, Iriel felt the Fourth-Rib bone flute at their side and the star-glass forks in their satchel weigh heavier, not like burdens but like instruments awaiting their cue, and they knew the city would judge each note by what was kept unspoken as much as by what was voiced.",

            "lines": "We bind not for love of binding, but because the city falls apart when names float like ash, and ash is what remains when oaths burn unchecked. You ask to see shutter ledgers and signal cords, and it is proper that I am minded to say no, because ungenerosity in dangerous hours is a kind of mercy the city rarely grants itself. Yet the ribs have hummed these last nights as if a miscount rode the wind, and I cannot audit anxiety with ink alone when breath itself writes on the Plaza’s bones. Bring me the whisper you followed, whole and unbroken, each curl of frost transcribed before the sun dissolves its edge, and bring me the identity of the one who breathed it without pronouncing their name into common air. In return I shall open a sliver of the signal-audit annex and place a writ in your hand that makes the Cartographer’s Needle look upon you not as a trespasser but as a question provisionally loved. Do not confuse the writ with belonging, for paper carries you only as far as it is believed, and belief in this city is measured against cords and countersigns. I will also place one of my own to watch you, not as a leash but as a witness, so that when questions come—and questions always come here—they will have more than your word and my ledger to eat."

            "lines": "I am to be your thread and needle, not your noose, though many a thread has strangled an errand when pulled from the wrong end. I keep lists that count breaths and lists that count silences, and I have learned the difference between a name that asks to be kept and a name that wants to burn the tongue that speaks it. The Needle hums at dawn and dusk like a bell deep under glass, and though I carry the Archivist’s sigil, I have never stood where maps breathe in and out and tell two truths that make a third. If you trust the writ, I will trust your lantern and your listening, for the green light is said to remember what frost forgets and to reveal where ink will not go. If you distrust the writ, I will trust your feet, because feet know when the ground lies even when the head is fooled by geometry and pride. Whatever we choose, I will walk beside you into the basalt flats and count our steps so that we do not lose our own number among stone-sprites and tilt-sick horizons. And when the Plaza gives up its breath-script, I will stand between your hand and the crowd so that the word you carry to the Loom is not stolen by mouths that cannot pay for what they take."

            "lines": "I’ll read the frost and speak the whisper into ink with care, for I have seen words shatter when asked to bear more weight than they were breathed to hold. If a name hangs in it like a glint of ice, I will carry that weight the way a lock-keeper carries pressure—felt in the bones, measured against the flood, never shouted over the water. The writ will open doors my flute can only shiver at, and the Needle has been asking me a question since the shardstorm cut this scar into my wrist, a question I owe an answer that breaks no taboos. I’ll keep you safe, Nalai, with green light for truce, cord-knots for the restless, and a fork-tone for the vertigo that takes folk on the flats, and if the maps try to write us into their margin, we’ll change the key they use and let the letters slide off. What I cannot promise is ease, because the River of No Echo takes sound and drowns it, and sometimes silence is heavier than any chain; but I can promise rhythm, and rhythm is how we cross. If Leth’s writ makes us visible, then let our visibility be a figure so exact that those who would twist it cut themselves on the edges. And when we return, the whisper will be whole, the name will be clean of public air, and the Needle will have heard us ask in a language it respects: not with breaking, but with tuning."

            "lines": "Do not mistake permission for protection, because permission is a candle and protection is a wall, and the wind in this city respects neither if they are poorly made. The writ makes you visible, and visibility is a tax we levy for order, which means those who evade tax will notice you and consider whether your light casts shadows worth standing in. Bring me the words as they fell cold from the breath that made them, every loop and eddy of frost, and bring me no cleverness about substitution or paraphrase, because the law here is carved closer than that. I will decide whether we owe the city more truth than comfort, and I will make that decision with my hand on the cord vault and my ear to the ribs, not with sentiment but with the arithmetic of harm. If the whisper is what rumor claims, then somewhere a ledger has been forged with breath and ice, and someone has used the Loom’s name to open a door reserved for floods and funerals. There is a price for that, measured not in chits alone, and I intend to collect it from the proper debtor. Go now before the sun blunts the writing on the Plaza, and remember that the first word of any contract is risk, written small because we like to pretend it isn’t there."

            "title": "Accept the writ and bind yourself to visibility",
            "text": "You take Leth Morrow’s writ as if it were a delicate bone gear, aware that it will grind if you force it and lock if you align it to the proper teeth. By accepting, you invite the gaze of both allies and rivals, knowing that permission creates witnesses as surely as it creates access. You plan the dawn: green-shutter lantern low, Nalai at your shoulder, and the frost-script waiting on Sternum Plaza like a song written for those who rise before the market’s noise. You will read the whisper, transcribe it stroke by breath-shaped stroke, and carry the identity it names as a knot in a cord rather than as a public mouthful. You will then lead Nalai to the basalt flats by the sanctioned path, bearing the writ high when the air hums wrong and the ground leans, trusting that paper and tone together will keep stone-sprites at watchful distance. On this course, you choose to make your movements legible, to let the city’s systems feel your steps, and to wager that legibility will constrain malice more than it tempts it. Every action will by design leave a careful echo in ledgers and in ribs so that lies find little purchase.",
            "outcome": "The frost-script reveals itself in crystalline breaths, each letter a fragile icicle that your green light does not melt, and your transcription catches the exact curl where the Loom’s name is bound to the Wyrmwell’s descent. Nalai screens you with a scribe’s calm, and a few hawkers glance and then look away, reading the writ’s sigil and calculating the cost of interference. You deliver the name to Leth by tightening a sealed cord over a matched chit within the Ledger-Safe Satchel, placing proof in his palm without voicing the syllables to the market’s air. The Archivist honors the bargain, unlocking the signal-audit annex long enough for you to glean patterns, and the sanctioned way to the Needle opens, its hum tolerating your approach like a gate testing a key. On the flats the geomantic vertigo brushes your bones, but the writ, the flute’s Fourth-Rib tone, and Nalai’s steady counting keep you upright while stone-sprites skulk at the edges of your notice, disappointed by the lack of lostness to feed on. Word of your visible passage travels along scribe-banks and watch posts, raising suspicion among the Riverwardens and the Grey Lanterns alike, but the writ outpaces rumor and keeps blades sheathed. You return with weariness and with maps reconsidered, bearing the same secret you left with, only heavier because it has now been measured and stored."

            "title": "Refuse the writ and move in green-shadow",
            "text": "You decline the parchment with a measured bow, choosing the old couriers’ rule that some routes are truer when unseen. Without the writ’s light, your steps must be quieter and your signals humbler, and you will lean on the green shutter more than the seal to make truce with eyes that know how to look away. At Sternum Plaza you go before even the oath-post warden yawns awake, leaving only your breath and the lantern’s hush to coax the frost to show its script. You will capture the words and the identity as a rubbing and a sequence of tuned taps, sealing both into the satchel and into a silent cord instead of into anyone’s ear. With Nalai you will take a side path toward the basalt flats, trusting your bone flute’s pitch against vertigo and letting the geography forget you as you pass, because sometimes a map cannot betray what it never notices. This course chooses discretion, a balance of ethics and suspicion, and a refusal to let legibility write you into someone else’s arithmetic. You accept that without a writ, help will take longer to arrive, and harm will have less paperwork to fear.",
            "outcome": "The Plaza’s breath-writing arrives thin and quick, and you must read with discipline, tracing each cold letter as if it could flee, but the transcription you make is exact and the name’s shape goes into a knot no passerby can unravel. Nalai watches you with new respect, seeing that refusal is not defiance but a different chord of duty, and together you dissolve into morning traffic before any clerk can pin you to a post. When you present the findings to Leth, you do so in private with the green lamp shuttered, and he studies the satchel’s seals with a frown that is more mathematics than anger. He considers your refusal, then opens the annex a narrower span—still enough to learn, though less than he might have offered—and he lets Nalai witness your restraint in the record so the Loom cannot pretend it did not happen. On the flats the air tilts harder without sanctioned escort, and stone-sprites test you with stolen pebbles and sideways echoes, but your flute’s tone and Nalai’s mnemonic counting pull you straight through. A vagrant in service to a nameless map tries to mirror your stride, yet loses interest when your path refuses to fix into a repeatable line. You return with the same rewards in substance and with fewer eyes able to claim a share of your story, though some doors you pass later will feel the friction of a choice not to be seen."

            "title": "Accept the writ but braid the name behind a veil",
            "text": "You take Leth’s writ and acknowledge the bargain, but you set your own boundary by preparing a ledger-safe braid driven not by letters but by pattern, a cipher the Loom itself taught the city to respect. At Sternum Plaza, you collect the frost words faithfully and seal them in ink, yet you capture the whisperer’s identity as a braided blank cord carrying the cadence of their breath rather than the vowels of their name. Nalai witnesses as you knot the cord with a rhythm that can be verified without being spoken, a compromise honoring the taboo against public utterance while satisfying the need for audit. You step toward the flats under sanction, your lantern a muted green as if to say that some truths deserve shade even with the law’s consent. This course chooses a third path: to be visible in motion but guarded in revelation, to let the city’s systems examine a lattice instead of a throat. It risks irritating those who prefer their truths sharp and ready to cut, but it protects the whisperer’s dignity until culpability, if any, is proven rather than assumed.",
            "outcome": "Leth receives the frost-script and the braided identity with a silence that suggests both approval and the promise of future interrogation, his fingers testing the braid’s integrity the way a harpist tests a string. The signal-audit annex opens, and its shelves offer just enough light to see how the Plaza’s whisper harmonizes with older, quieter debts, granting you the patterns you came for without exposing your source to the casual cruelty of rumor. On the road to the Needle, sanctioned marks keep would-be meddlers at the respectful distance where gossip turns to calculation and dies, and Nalai records that the identity has been delivered in a form the Loom recognizes without making a spectacle of it. The basalt flats nudge your balance, but the flute’s Fourth-Rib tone steadies the world’s tilt, and stone-sprites skitter away from a procession whose geometry refuses to be stolen. When you return, Leth’s ledger notes and Nalai’s witness line up, and your restraint becomes part of the official story, a line that others must read before they can decide to be angry. Some in the Loom find your caution inconvenient, yet they admit the work is sound, and your reputation within the Pale Collegium rises for having kept both law and dignity in the same hand."

            "text": "You angle your green-shutter lantern toward a high window of Phosphor House before dawn, spelling a truce-lit route that tells the Grey Lanterns to watch but not to interfere, and to mirror any tampering they see. With that reflection set, you accept Leth’s writ and proceed to Sternum Plaza, intent on creating a triangle of accountability—Loom, Lantern, and your own ledger—so that the whisper is not devoured by a single mouth. You read the frost-script with extreme care, writing the words twice, once for audit and once for cross-check, and you store the identity as a sealed chit paired to a silent knot that two registries can verify without hearing a syllable. Nalai frowns at drawing in the Lanterns but concedes that a mirrored truth can discourage private edits, and together you set off for the Needle under a rhythm that feels larger than two pairs of feet. This course risks displeasing those who loathe shared custody of secrets, but it reduces the chance that the Loom or its enemies will claim you invented a breath you merely caught. It is a weaver’s tactic, tying three cords so that if one frays the fabric still holds, and trusting that in Marrowgate, balance is sometimes safer than singular authority.",
            "outcome": "The frost yields and your twin transcriptions match, the second sealing your confidence when the first feels like it might be a trick of light, and Nalai marks the concord in tidy strokes. You deliver the identity as a sealed chit and a silent knot, and Leth’s lips thin at the mention of reflected custody, yet he opens the annex and honors the writ because to do otherwise would concede that his authority fears a mirror. On the flats the wind rises and the ground leans, but the truce-route you signaled beforehand grants you a window of quiet passage, as if the city itself prefers fewer accidents on a day this visible. Stone-sprites test the edges of your attention and then retreat, puzzled by a path that repeats on three ledgers at once and thus refuses to be kidnapped into someone else’s map. Back in the Scribehouse, there are murmurs among clerks and a cool nod from a masked figure in a far gallery, and though politics sharpen around you, the work you brought is unassailable from two directions at once. The Grey Lanterns take credit for nothing and keep receipts for everything, and you walk away with the same sanction and satchel promised, plus the knowledge that your truth, once recorded, will not be easily shifted by rumor or wrath."
