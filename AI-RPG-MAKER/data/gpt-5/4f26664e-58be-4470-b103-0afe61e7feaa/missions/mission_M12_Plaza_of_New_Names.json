    "description": "Back in Sternum Plaza, the frost-script at dawn writes differently for the first time in living memory. The Accord of Living Flow is sung aloud and matched to the Loom’s new braid, and the Bone-Market hawkers fall quiet as the ribs hum in agreement. Leth Morrow, pale with the strain of surrendering a measure of control, calls Iriel forward to witness the city’s own name accept the wyrm’s breath. Brunna Coil and Avar Ir argue the practicalities of bearing maintenance without pillage; Safra Ninebridges signs the Salt Ledger with a proud hand; Edris Thale tolls the Bone Bell by hand, no omen, just thanksgiving. Jull Nerr offers a terse nod from the crowd; Suri Yal’s smile is a small private harbor. The Grey Lanterns shutter green once and then go dark, content to let the rumor be true by day. In the hush after the vow, the ribs stop creaking. They hum.",

Today we ask a name to bind us back, and I will tell you something I never tell anyone: I am afraid. But I would rather be afraid in the light than powerful in the dark. Iriel Vask, speak your own debt aloud and let us end it as citizens, not as supplicants."

Under this Accord, I buy it back with service counted in chords and oaths held true, and I give it back to the city not as collateral but as promise. If I ever forget the sound the ribs make when they are content, let this flute remind me and shame me in equal measure."
