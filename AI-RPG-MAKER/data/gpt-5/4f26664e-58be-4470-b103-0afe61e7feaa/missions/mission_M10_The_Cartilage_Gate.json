    "description": "The routes align: Needle tone, pacification cords, bearing fragment, and the lens to read them. Prior Edris Thale asks Iriel to join a sanctioned descent at the Wyrmwell under triple-seal with Suri Yal, a small Lantern detail, and wardens of the Order. The cartilage gate waits below where air smells of old storms, its seam sealed with prayer and fear. The pacification rite must be sung while the lens reads the stress lines, and the Needle’s tone set like a key in a lock that the city forgot it owned. Hollow Pilgrims have already sabotaged a winch and wait with rope-halters woven in taboos, hoping to let the wyrm’s last breath rush free and remake the city with one vast unpayable debt to wonder. The choice is not whether to open the gate, but how to open it so the breath can be bottled and shaped rather than loosed like a knife.",

We open this gate as surgeons, not zealots, and we close it like archivists who know that some pages must be turned with gloves and some with callused fingers. Sing with me and we will set a mercy over what wants to be a miracle."

Keep the Lanterns from stepping where I’m stepping, keep the Pilgrims from cutting our ropes, and when the seam sighs, push. We’ve tuned a bearing together; we can tune a city’s throat."

If wonder is owed to us, we will earn it with patience instead of robbery. If the wyrm chose to hold shut a wound, I will not be the knife that unlearns that choice."
