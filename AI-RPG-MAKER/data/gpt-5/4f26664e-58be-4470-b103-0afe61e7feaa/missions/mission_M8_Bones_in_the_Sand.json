    "description": "The stabilized gates will not hold unless their bearing-bones are reinforced with denser ossature than Marrowgate has on hand. Waymother Safra Ninebridges of the Nadiri Caravan Court agrees to guide Iriel into the Ossuary Dunes where pre-wyrm fragments sometimes rise after storms. The dunes sing like an empty cathedral, and bone squalls strip patience as easily as skin. Safra’s bridge-feast hospitality disarms and discloses: the Riverwardens’ austerity has starved Nadiri contracts and tightened the Salt-Tithe to a choking thread. To secure a fragment, Iriel must choose between convincing the Nadiri to trust the city’s writs or offering a new guarantee backed by the Loom’s reluctant writ and Iriel’s own name. The Hollow Pilgrims prowl the lee of femur-spires, whispering they want the wyrm awake to make all debts moot.",

        "Drive off or evade the Hollow Pilgrims without breaking bearing-bones or violating taboos.",
        "Secure the ossature fragment and agree terms for Nadiri compensation."

We guided your grandparents through these bones when the Ash Rains were a fresh story, and now your Riverwardens lecture us on tolls as if tides were theirs to appoint. Share my salt and we will talk. Promise me a fair weight and a fair hearing, and I will show you where the old giants still shrug in their sleep."

I cannot undo a tithe with a sentence, but I can carry your grievance back wrapped in the Council’s seal and my own promise to speak until someone more powerful hears. Help me bring a bone that does not break, and I will help you bend a custom that has grown cruel."
