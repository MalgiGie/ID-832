    "description": "Lady Sereth Vex convenes a closed session at Skull Keep’s eye hall. Under the lantern glow, the Council of Cartilages bickers: Kiln-Queen Avar Ir demands access to new star-glass veins; Master Brunna Coil wants to claim any pre-wyrm ossature exposed by the recent bone-squalls; Prior Edris Thale warns the taboos are creaking. Iriel lays the Resonance Map on the council table and the floor seems to tilt toward it. Before debate can knot, a runner gasps that the River of No Echo is surging in a way not measured on any pressure map. Sereth Vex orders Iriel, Edris, and a Riverwarden squad below to the sumped vault beneath the Keep, where relic-silt gathers and prophets brew self-writing ink. The vault’s door is already damp with letters that compose themselves into a warning as the river presses at the stone: when the Seventh Rib breaks, the silence will finally speak.",

Take your map and your flute and the Prior’s cords and go below my Keep where the old treaties drip into ink. Hold the pressure as if it were your own breath and bring me words I can command instead of omens I can only fear."

We will set the low chant and you will set the tone, and between prayer and pitch we will ask the city to remember its oaths to live. If the ink writes a prophecy, we will treat it as a witness, not a master."
