    "description": "At dusk, Gate Three stutters like a heart that will not answer its own beat. Suri Yal meets Iriel atop the bone-crowned wheel as the River of No Echo moves without sound beneath. The fork’s tone reveals a foreign overtone lodged in the bearing—thin, cold, and bright as a shardstorm memory. Eased out with bone chalk and careful pressure, the culprit proves to be star-glass splinters etched with a shutter code, their edges singing an alien rhythm that trips the gate into hesitation. Harbormaster Jull Nerr tramps up the stair with lock-militia boots, suspicion heavy as the humid silence. He orders the evidence secured, but Suri’s weary glance carries an unspoken plea to take this to those who understand signals in the dark: the Grey Lanterns at Phosphor House.",

I told Jull we needed a clean run to second lantern, and now the river sits like an insult. If that’s star-glass in my gate, I’ll make the Kiln Syndicate drink their slag."

I want those shards sealed, logged, and put under Harbor House lock. And you, Vask—your passes are as thin as your excuses. One unsanctioned whisper to your lamp-friends and I’ll have you counting gulls from the outer booms."

If I carry a copy to the Grey Lanterns, I can bring back the truth of the code and the hand that etched it. The gate will hold because you held it; let me hold the rumor it’s choking on."
