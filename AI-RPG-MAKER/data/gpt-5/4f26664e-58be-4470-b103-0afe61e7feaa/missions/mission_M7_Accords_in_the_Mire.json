    "description": "The self-writing ink scrawls a corollary: bind the newly unsettled or they will be gathered by something that is not death. The path leads east into the Mire of Quiet Dust to consult Chirothegn Marek Sol and the Grave-Binders. There, sootwater breathes cold and cords hang heavy with old plague prayers. Marek receives Iriel with ash on his brow and patient gravity. He teaches the ancient sigils for pacifying the recently dead and the recently frightened, which are not so different, and warns that the Dustmother’s sleep will be offered if Iriel lingers. To carry the binding safely, Iriel must walk the fen with memory sharp and breath measured, and cut a set of fresh ash-cords at an altar that still remembers mercy.",

The sigils I give are not chains; they are hands held until shaking passes. You will not ink them on paper. You will learn them in your marrow and in the pulse you feel in your wrist when you put two fingers there and the world agrees you are alive."

If she comes to me in soot and gentleness again, I will bow, but I will not lie down.
