    "description": "The bound breath hums like distant rain inside its vessel, and the Needle map insists on one final route: the Hollow March. Lady Sereth Vex asks Iriel to carry the vessel to the menhir fields and ring the buried Bone Bell with Custodian blood, summoning the oldest council whether they wish it or not. The menhirs lean to listen as storm clouds hunt the iron in the party’s gear. When the bell is struck, the soldiers of stone stand not to fight, but to witness, their hollow faces turned to the vessel. Sereth bleeds into the grass, honors the taboo, and demands the city choose. Leth Morrow arrives uninvited with Nalai Thread, ledger-cords in hand; Avar Ir stands with slag-bright confidence; Edris Thale’s prayers are steady as knotted cords; Safra Ninebridges watches to see if bridges or tolls will be made. The breath must be poured not into gates or coffers, but into the city’s name, to give Marrowgate a say in its own fate. To do this, debts must be loosed and retied without strangling the poor or freeing the cruel.",

If we can agree to be kinder with our strength and stingier with our cruelty, the breath will hold us to it like a song you cannot forget, even when you are angry."
