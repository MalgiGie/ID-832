    "description": "The Cartographer’s Needle rises from basalt flats like a commandment. At dawn, its etched lattices hum in step with Marrowgate’s ribs. With Nalai Thread’s nervous curiosity and Lysa’s distant blessing, Iriel sounds the fourth-rib flute. The spire answers with a chord that folds the air, and a seam opens in shadow, exhaling the dust of roads-that-could-be. Inside is an archive of maps that redraw themselves with each breath, routes that exist when moon and council will agree. Stone-sprites flicker like doubts, trying to steal direction from pockets. At the archive’s heart, a slab shows three loci pulsing in sympathy: the sumped vault beneath Skull Keep, the cartilage gate at the Wyrmwell, and a broken ring in the Skyfall Shardfield where a crown once was. The Needle’s voice is not voice at all, but a certainty in the bones: something is using old routes to move a new design.",

If these maps decide we should be roads, will we be paved smooth or marked with potholes? I am not sure I was meant to see the world pacing itself into ifs and thens."

The sprites steal direction, not courage; if you doubt, speak a number that matters to you and step where the hum is thickest. The map knows where the city bleeds and where it breathes—Skull Keep, the Wyrmwell, and Skyfall. It’s telling us that the routes beneath us are being tuned by a hand that remembers old emergencies."
