    "description": "The League of Lanterns has been seeing double: veils that peel wrong and coded flashes that ride the Veiled Current like thieves laughing under a curtain. Tamas Eelwick, your lantern-running friend, brings you a slate scratched with frantic shorthands and the stink of oil on his sleeves. Pirates are testing a backdoor through the Tenth Mouth, and someone with a clean berth is helping them slip past the chain-gates. Windward Bastion will not act on rumor and glow alone; you will have to carry the light and the proof to Captain-Major Sorev Katch and then help set a decoy signal to turn the cut-throats toward a net instead of the Lamplands. The last time blackouts were run in this city, a cutter went down, and one Warden didn't come up. The old guilt licks like a cold wave around your ribs as the lanterns gutter in rehearsal, and the Bastion's stormglass panes whisper with wind.",

        "Deliver the slate to Sorev Katch at Windward Bastion and convince him to authorize a decoy lantern play.",

Someone with dock-rights is holding a lantern crooked on purpose. I don't like it, Tairn. If we don't turn them, they'll crease into the Lamplands like a knife into wet reed. Take this slate. I tried to clean it, but the message won't be pretty no matter how you polish it."

            "content": "I've seen forged slates, and I've seen fear make honest men see ghosts in lamp smoke. But this code has the smell of truth—greasy and inconvenient. We'll set a curtain of dark and a net behind it. Understand: I won't have a repeat of the Corsair Year under my watch, and I won't let Lanterns play hero without Wardens to hold the line. You run those signals clean, and my boats will be where your shadows tell them to be."
