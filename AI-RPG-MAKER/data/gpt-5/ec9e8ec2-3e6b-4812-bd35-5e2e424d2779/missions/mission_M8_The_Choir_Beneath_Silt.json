    "description": "When the tide lowers and silt breathes out, the Silted Basilica’s organ groans with a sound that makes the hair along your arms think about prayers. The Faith of Azerene has traced fault-lines through the city's oaths since the Beacon's keen, and Myris Khel believes the answer to the city's restless song lies in an older choir. The Nacre Crown is said to rest in a reliquary guarded by bubbles that steal breath; if brought to the surface, the Crown might hush lies long enough for all to hear what is true. The League of Lanterns has mapped a safe descent path for a single tide's length. You will dive with a line at your waist and a shell prayer on your tongue, and you will meet more than water below. The Pearl-Warder is said to barter bones and breath; you wonder which of yours you can spare.",

If you feel the shells listening for your heart, do not lie to them even in your head. They are kinder than men, but less patient. Bring it to me, and I will set it where it cannot be bought and where it can be asked for only with clean hands."

You carry a hook for others and a knot for yourself. Do not lie to me. One lie here and the city breathes water instead of air for a day, and then you will understand what a Crown is for. Take it. Do not wear it. Promise me with your warm shard of lightning and your cold shard of fear."
