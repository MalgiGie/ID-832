    "city": "Marinth Vell, the Tideglass Metropolis, rises on piles and causeways over the nine estuarine inlets that form the Harbor of Nine Mouths along the Sunken Pearl coast. Its skyline glows with living towers of blue-green tideglass that shimmer and hum when the moon draws the tide. The city was founded 412 years ago by desert refugees from Khelar, led by the tidal oracle Myr Sal, who read the river and storm as if they were books; guided to the coast, they survived their first winter by melting black sand and mangrove resin in a thunder-wracked caldera to birth a beacon of singing glass that lured shoals and sailors alike to safe water. From that first beacon, Marinth Vell seeded a craft, a faith, and a state. The city is braced by chain-gates across each inlet, and its nine districts—Spillward, Prism Quay, Brinemarket, Chainmouth, Piles' End, Salt Gate, Lamplands, Glassward, and Archive Crown—are stitched by bridges, ferry-ropes, and glimmering walkways that flex with the tide. Economy and culture pivot on the art of tideglass: living glass coaxed to grow like coral with songs and resin, set with storm-born fulgurites, and hardened with salt rites. Fishers and kelp-harvesters set out at dawn past the Glassreef Shoals, while caravans arrive through the Salt Gate bearing slabs from the Sere Flats and obsidian grit from the Shattercoast Cliffs for the kilns of Prism Quay. The Brine Archive carves law and ledger into slabs of salt and resin, while the Conclave of Prismancers wraps memory and light into lenses that can be replayed like music. Governance is officially a Trium of tide-lords—the Harbormistress (currently Nerey Alis), the Archivist-Talon (Var Sile), and the Speaker of Piles (Jorden Tatch)—but real power eddies among guilds and houses: the Glassworkers' Concord, the Dockers' Syndicate, House Saltvein, the River Wardens, and the Faith of Azerene, the Censered Tide. Marinth Vell depends on salt from the Sere Flats, resin from the Elder Mangrove of Iska, and storms above the Storm-Kiln Caldera to keep its tideglass craft alive; each is controlled or contested by a different faction, creating a lattice of obligation. Festivals mark the city's rhythm: the Nine Mouths Unfettered when the chain-gates are lifted together to draw the sea's favor; the Glass Blossom when a new tower is seeded in the Nursery; and Azerene's Candles when shells filled with oil and prayers are set adrift. Threats whisper beneath prosperity: pirates skirting the Veiled Current; the leviathan Uln, said to sleep under the shoals; salt tariffs that can starve the poor; and old Khelaran ghosts who haunt mirrors when storms make the tideglass sing. Marinth Vell is a city that remembers in salt and glass, and it owes its survival to the sea it tries to name.",
