The Nine Mouths Unfettered is a festival of trust, a day when the chain-gates are lifted together and the harbor becomes one bright lung, drawing in tide and sending out song. Tideglass towers tremble with color, the Beacon of Myr Sal hums in a chord that tastes of tin and rain, and the Lantern crews lace the dusk with signals that stutter in odd, unsettling patterns. Behind market laughs and salt-sweet candies, Wardens trade tight words with Dockers, and rumor moves like slick oil: that pirates mean to ride the Veiled Current straight through the open chains, timing their incursion to the heartbeat of the crowd. The Tenth Mouth—the one no map admits—aches like a pulled tooth in every pilot’s mind, and even the shells at Court hang heavier as if listening for treason they do not yet know how to name. You, Tairn Latch, stand on a chainhouse stair where the city’s breath climbs and falls beneath your boots, called by Captain-Major Sorev Katch and your mentor Isha Brinehand to do a thing no one expected and everyone needs: weld rescue and defense into one rhythm under your shout. The Nacre Crown has been brought up from the Silted Basilica under oaths and prayers, its mother-of-pearl humming with an old patience that once steadied a drowning city, and it waits in the Court of Echoing Shells for the hand that will bear it before the masses. Your secret—years-old and sharp, a blackout that saved the Lamplands at the cost of a Warden in the fog—settles in your chest like a stone that grew there, heavy and exact. On any other day you would carry it alone until it ground you down; on this day the city demands one body and one breath, and stones in one lung make the whole chest rise crooked. Shells do not forgive, but sometimes they hush for a truth said at the right time, and sometimes crews move truer once the lie is named.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Coordinate joint River Wardens and Dockers' Syndicate teams to guard the chainhouses during the Nine Mouths Unfettered festival.\",\n        \"Use the Nacre Crown’s presence to steady the crowd if panic threatens.\",\n        \"Publicly address the blackout secret at the Court or choose to remain silent, affecting morale and coordination.\",\n        \"Repel the pirate incursion attempting to slip through the Tenth Mouth and raise the chains in time.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sorev Katch\", \"lines\": \"I do not like asking a Docker to run a Warden’s line, but I like the taste of drowning a great deal less, and today the harbor could swallow pride and men alike if we do not lash our efforts tight. You know the chains, and you know the people who will climb them when they sing, and that is two knowings I need sitting in one skull that can count to ten when the storm counts to chaos. Set the drills as if the pirates were already in our pockets, and make every rescue step pull double as a way to choke a boarding party on their own daring. My cutters will watch the Current, my chainhouses will answer your call, and if a lantern blinks wrong, I will want the reason spoken quick and loud enough to travel through rain. And Latch—however you carry your ghosts, secure them so they do not wander loose on my stairs; men stumble more on memories than on wet iron, and I cannot have either trip us when the gates go up.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isha Brinehand\", \"lines\": \"Weigh your words on the meteoric slate before you put them under the Shells, because once you set them there they will not sit quiet again, not in your mouth and not in the mouths of the city. If a truth will get in the way of our hands, better to speak it now when we can set our feet for the sway, rather than in the instant when the links are singing and a shout turns to a scream. My people will follow your voice because you do not spend breath cheap, and because you have pulled weight that wasn’t yours and never asked the tally-keepers to count it twice. We will dress our rig and our hearts the same way—no frayed ends, no hidden knots, and no proud slack—and we will bring them all home if there is any bringing to be had. Bring them home, Latch, and then we will count what remains and who owes who a drink and an apology, and the city can measure us by what we kept rather than by how loudly we swore we would keep it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nerey Alis\", \"lines\": \"I have presided over chains and storms enough to know that the worst squall is the one whose first wind is a cheer, and a festival can be a gale if one fool lights the wrong spark. The Beacon hums in a chord I do not like, a chord that sounds like a lie left too long on a shelf, and I will not have my harbor turned into a stage for pirates or for anyone else’s theater. Take the Nacre Crown up from the Court when the time comes; it steadied this city once when memory swam and faith drowned, and it can make a crowd breathe as one if the bearer’s heart does not tremble. I have put Wardens and Dockers under your call, and the Trium will answer for that later, but I judge the price worth the paying if nine gates rise and nine gates fall on our timing, not on a corsair’s prayer. Do your work without varnish, keep your counts truer than weights under the House of Weights slate, and give me, at the end of it, a harbor that hums with relief rather than with regret.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tamas Eelwick\", \"lines\": \"The lantern talk out on the marsh is dirty tonight, Tairn, like someone dragged it through silt and didn’t rinse it proper, and the Veils flicker in patterns that smell like pirate hands on our books. I caught a code tucked in the color drift—two quick, one long, then a hold—that means a Tenth Mouth pilot has marked our festival as a door with no hinge, and he thinks himself clever enough to walk through it twice. I can seed decoys where the Current shows its teeth, but only if your Wardens will not chase my ghosts and leave the real teeth free to bite, and only if your Dockers accept a blackout in the right places without thinking it’s a thief’s favor. You taught me to keep oil for the places that need it and dark for the places that must hide, and I have done as you taught, but tonight I need your shout to tell the difference when cheers drown sense. Give me your plan so I can lace it with light the way a net is laced with knots, each one meant and none of them left to luck, and I will carry that plan until my feet burn and my hands glow.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tairn Latch\", \"lines\": \"Years ago, when fog made the Lamplands into a bowl of breath and echo, I helped paint a night darker than it needed to be, and a River Warden drowned where my lantern winked twice and should have held steady. I have carried that in my knots and my sleep, a shard I do not show, and the weight of it has leaned my shoulder even when my hands were empty of any other burden. I am sorry beyond what the shells can measure, and I am ready to set that sorrow where all can hear it if hearing it will make our line straighter and our hands quicker. Today we lift a chain together and we do not let it drop until every child sees home-light on water and not the burn of ships dying, and I will not add one more ghost to the stairs if I can help it. Move on my count, breathe on my count, and when I say haul, we will haul the city through this tide as if it were a rafter caught in flood, and we will not let go until it is lashed safe to tomorrow.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Bear the Nacre Crown to the Court and confess before the festival drums begin\", \"text\": \"You take the Nacre Crown in both hands, its weight cool and sure as tide in bone, and you walk into the Court of Echoing Shells before lanterns are fully lit and before the chains lift their first inch. You speak your blackout, not as excuse but as inventory, and you let the shells keen and then hush in the same breath so the city can hear the shape of what is forgiven and what is remembered. You look to the Wardens who lost a man and to the Dockers whose feast was saved, and you name both debts without asking to be paid in anything but steadied hands today. You tell them that a city is a crew and crews move better when they know which planks have already cracked and been mended, and that you are mended and will bend but not break under their eyes. You finish by promising that every signal tonight will be honest and every darkness purposeful, and that you will not sell one life to buy another if any other bargain remains.\", \"outcome\": \"The shells hush and the Nacre Crown throws a cool, pearly light that steadies the breath of those in the Court and, by rumor’s fast river, steadies the breath of those waiting on the quays. Wardens who had carried a quiet hatred set it down like a bucket they had grown used to holding, and some of them shift closer to your call rather than sideways from it, their captains nodding once where before they would not look. Dockers answer your count with a new sharpness, proud not of you but with you, and the joint drills snap into rhythm as if someone tightened a hidden drum, making rescue routes double as choke points with elegance instead of accident. When the pirates ride the Veiled Current’s slick back and show themselves in the cheering, your decoy lights lace them into channels you meant, and your chainhouses raise iron in a clean sequence that closes the Tenth Mouth like a jaw. The fight is bitter but brief, the chains rise in time, and though there are bruises and blood, there is no stampede; by dawn, the harbor hums with relief instead of regret, and your name is carried in the crowd like a rope that did not break.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Hold your silence and pour everything into drills, timing, and decoys\", \"text\": \"You touch the Nacre Crown as if to test a balance and leave it in its cradle, choosing to bank the fire of confession for a day when the city is not built of tinder. You throw yourself into the math of the harbor until numbers drown the shape of your old night, staging practice lifts until iron sings from muscle memory and not from fear. You place Tamas’s decoys where only someone who has watched the Veils fold could have guessed, and you brief Wardens and Dockers in a strict cadence that leaves no room for questions you are not ready to answer. You walk every stair where feet might tangle, you lash every coil where panic might snag, and you speak in the clipped tone of a rigger who will allow no slack to live. You promise results without the story, and you mean to buy the city’s safety with sweat and good timing rather than with a wound turned outward for all to see.\", \"outcome\": \"The festival opens clean and bright, and for a glittering hour your drills hold the shape of a perfect plan, the harbor moving on your count as if every bridge had learned to breathe. But rumor is a faster tide than discipline, and somewhere a lantern-runner whispers your old night to a Warden who already suspects, and that whisper breeds a stagger on a stair that never needed to happen. The stagger becomes a small tangle at Chainmouth when two crews hesitate over who has the lead, and that tangle becomes a brief gap that a pirate cutter noses into like a rat finding a pantry seam. You and yours slam the seam shut with strength and grit, and the chains rise in time after hard minutes that feel like hours, but the price is paid in longer bruises and one more name spoken at dawn than there might have been. The city is saved without panic, the pirates are driven off snarling, and your reputation is a tighter knot—strong in the eyes of many Dockers, wary in the eyes of certain Wardens, and sharpened in the eyes of pirates who saw how close you came to making a perfect map of their failure.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Confess in the thick of the crisis, using the Crown’s hush like a keel\", \"text\": \"You begin the festival in motion, letting drills and lantern codes and chainhouse chants braid into a single rope, and you keep your secret coiled as part of the line. When the first pirate sails slip like knives out of applause and the crowd leans toward fear, you seize the Nacre Crown and climb where your voice can cross water, choosing that instant to set your stone where everyone can see the dent it left in you. You speak fast and clean, not cutting detail but not letting any word turn self-serving, and you let the Crown’s hush wash the crowd back from the edge without washing away their anger at the men who would cut throats during a feast. You look at Sorev, and he looks back with eyes that read a ledger they did not write, and you look at Isha, whose nod is a nail driven home in a beam that will not split, and then you point and count and bring the city back into its practiced steps. The confession rides the crisis like a keel rides a wave—dangerous if misjudged, steadying if true—and you make of it not a plea but a load-bearing story that the crowd can stand on rather than sink into.\", \"outcome\": \"The moment teeters and then comes right, the Crown’s pearly calm joining your hard rhythm until cheers shift into work-sound and work-sound shifts into something like faith. Pirates who planned to surf panic find instead a harbor that closes ranks without closing eyes, and your decoys thread them into channels where Warden cutters and Docker hook-gangs can gut their momentum. A few old Wardens spit, but more of them shoulder in at your count, and the Dockers move with a heat that is not rage but resolve, making rescue and defense the same muscle flexed two ways. The chains lift in a staggered beauty that keeps the Tenth Mouth from ever fully forming, and when the last shout echoes off tideglass it is a shout of completion rather than of grief. By dawn, you are spent and salted, but the city’s talk names your choice as the lever that turned fear into function, and even those who dislike you find themselves admitting that the harbor moved truer because the lie stopped trying to steer.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M10\"], \"next\": [\"M12\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Commendation\", \"description\": \"Public commendation at the Court of Echoing Shells (civic standing boost).\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Policy Change\", \"description\": \"Formal creation of a Joint Safety Muster: Dockers gain a consult seat with the River Wardens.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Reputation: +Large with Dockers’ Syndicate and River Wardens; pirates’ enmity is secured and sharpened.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
