The Veiled Current peels its phosphor veils not like soft cloth but like a cracked mirror, reflections slipping out of true while the lamplighters whisper new codes through teeth that taste of oil. Tamas Eelwick meets you in the Lamplands under a hooded lantern that paints your hands green and blue, pressing a slate against your palm that feels warmer than it should, as if the stolen routes etched into it still run too fast. The rumors are shaped like knives: pirates are testing a backdoor through the whispered Tenth Mouth, and some clean-berthed traitor within the chain-gates crooks a light for their passage. Windward Bastion stares seaward with stormglass eyes, but it will not blink for rumor and shimmer; Captain-Major Sorev Katch demands proof that can be weighed like a chain link and struck like a bell. The rehearsal lanterns gutter and recover, practicing the blackout braid that will pull the skiffs toward a net instead of toward the Lamplands' sleeping porches, and every time the lights die your ribs remember cold water and the single Warden you could not pull into your boat on the old dark night. The panes in the Bastion's lookouts whisper with wind, and you can hear in the glass the far thunder of the Storm-Kiln, as if the city itself is sucking breath between teeth, as if the gods are leaning in for a better listen. The Beacon of Myr Sal hums low on the far skyline, and its song seems to ask whether the city will keep faith with those who hold the line and those who are led to nets. Between guilt and duty there is a causeway no wider than a ferry-plank; you balance on it, hook-hand ready, chain-arm tight, and you set your jaw to carry both light and burden. If the ambuscade holds, the pirates will learn fear of honest dark; if it falters, the Lamplands will count lanterns not by number but by names cut short.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Tamas at a Lamplands signal tower and receive the coded slate of pirate routes.\",\n        \"Deliver the slate to Sorev Katch at Windward Bastion and convince him to authorize a decoy lantern play.\",\n        \"Help the League of Lanterns run a controlled blackout to funnel pirate skiffs into a Warden ambuscade.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tamas Eelwick\", \"lines\": \"You know how a veil should fall when the Current runs soft, Tairn—the way it drapes itself smooth as eel-skin and the light in it sighs toward harbor. Tonight it folded like oil on ice, slick on slick, and the code in the peel wasn't ours, though it tried to sing our tune with a sour harmony that tasted like rusted chain. Someone with dock-rights and an honest berth is holding a lantern crooked on purpose, and their crookedness lays a mouth where no chain-house lantern should, a Tenth Mouth with teeth. I followed the flash-phrases through three towers and a blackout pocket, and every step I took the shadows laughed like men who think they know our lanes better than we do. I don't like it, Tairn, and I don't like how my hands shake even as I steady the hood, because fear makes fools and heroes from the same wood and I am tired of splinters. Take this slate; it is scratched in the League’s short-hands and bruised with oil, and I tried to clean it, but the message won't be pretty no matter how you polish it, because it names a path cut right under the Bastion's nose. I came to you because you read lamp-talk with your shoulders as much as your eyes, and because when the water goes black you remember who needs hauling first. If Windward won't move on glow alone, we will feed them truth and then we will set a darkness we own and a net behind it, and if my light fails in my hands, your hook will not.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sorev Katch\", \"lines\": \"I've seen forged slates, and I have seen fear make honest men see ghosts bloom in lamp smoke, and I have cut both from my watch with the same knife. But this code stinks of brine and coin and the particular grease of truth—greasy and inconvenient, exactly like the kind that makes a man wipe his palm on his coat before he signs. You bring me a route stitched through a Tenth Mouth, and I will set a curtain of controlled dark and a net behind it, and I will station my cutters on the downflow so the Current itself lends them speed. Understand me, I will not have a repeat of the Corsair Year under my watch, and I will not let Lanterns play hero without Wardens on the line and safety crews rigged like extra ribs for the city. We will run the decoy lantern play by the book and under my hand, and any man who thinks to improvise will find Brinehand's glove fits his cheek as well as it fits an oath. You run those signals clean and clipped with no flourishes, and my boats will be where your shadows tell them to be, and if a Warden goes into the water it will be because the sea wanted him, not because a message wore the wrong light. And if this traitor holds a clean berth within my chains, I will taste the brackish sweat of their false oath at Salt Gate myself before I clap irons on their wrists.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isha Brinehand\", \"lines\": \"My dockers do not drown so that merchants can clap and priests can hum; they drown because scales are shaved, rigs are left to rot, and the tide makes no polite exceptions, and I have sworn my hands to bend those odds. If Wardens mean to set nets and Lanterns mean to pull a blackout, then we will braid safety lines between chain-houses and ladder the quay with riggers who measure breath in pulls, not in prayers. I remember your father's season and your broken boy's jaw set like a door-bar, Tairn, and I hauled you from a fouled chain once and found the city clinging to your coat; I will not hand you back to the dark without the tools to bite it. Tell Katch we want muster stairs cleared and storm-rigs checked twice, and tell the League we want their code-leaf kept clean—one signal for rescue and one for net, no cleverness that gets a worker dead. You take this coil with knots the Knotted Wives swore to hold in foul water, and you make sure those boats that think they own the Current find themselves owned by a city that remembers its drowned. If anyone tries to turn blame onto labor after, I will stand in the Court of Echoing Shells and let the shells keen their throats dry while I call names, because we keep receipts in salt and scar both.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tairn Latch\", \"lines\": \"We run it tight and we run it cold, no flourishes and no heroics that draw more blood than the tide already taxes; one blackout, one hook, one haul, and no one goes home with a story prettier than the work. The Current will take them where we ask if we sing the light true, and where we ask is toward a net set by Wardens who remember how to pull together instead of apart. Captain Katch, I will put my name and my breath on this, and if anything tilts crooked because a signal cracked or a courage failed, I will stand to it as fault is mine before any shell or judge asks, because I am done letting ghosts speak for me. Tamas, your slate warms my palm like a fulgurite clenched during an oath, and that heat says a thing I hate to hear: that there is honesty in this danger, and we must meet it honestly or let it eat us like soft wood. Isha, your coil sits heavy across my shoulder like an extra promise, and I will use it first for the man most likely to be forgotten, because if the city is an instrument as the Conclave claims, then the note that makes it true is the one that saves a name. We go now before the veils change their fold, and when we return we will eat eel stew with oil still on our sleeves and talk quietly about the night the city decided to own its darkness.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Confess the old blackout and ask for joint command\", \"text\": \"You stand before Sorev Katch not as a runner of errands but as a man with a weight, and you lay the weight down where it can be measured. You tell him about the night years ago when the League ran a blackout to spare the Lamplands and how a Warden cutter went down in the confusion, and how one man did not come back up, and how that ghost has walked beside your shadow ever since. You do not make excuses; you name names where it hurts you, and you offer the shape of your failure as a map to avoid, not a badge to kiss. You ask for joint command of the decoy play—Lanterns on light, Wardens on steel, Dockers on rescue lines—so that no single hand turns the city blind without others feeling the same dark on their skin. You promise to take public fault if anything goes wrong again, and you ask him to take public credit if it goes right, because you know what it costs a guard to admit he needed a lamplighter. Five sentences do not empty a heart, but they do set an edge that can cut through habit and pride.\", \"outcome\": \"Katch listens with the stillness of a tide before it turns, and when you finish he rests his palm flat on the stormglass table as if to keep the sea from rising up through it. He tells you that he respects a man who brings his own gallows to the square and asks for a fair rope, and he does not smile when he grants joint command, but he nods to your spine as if it were an iron bar he could know. He multiplies safety crews and sets a second line of cutters a breath farther down the Current, a gesture that will not show in any ledger but will show in the number of lungs that still draw morning air. The operation runs with a tense clarity that feels like holding your breath under clean water, and when the pirates bite the dark and find net instead of passage, the first shout goes up from a Warden boat and the second from a Docker on a rescue line, and they meet halfway in the spray. After, a rumor moves through the Lamplands that a confession was made and taken like salt on the tongue, and the League’s senior lanterns mark you as a man who will spend his courage publicly, while a few Wardens who have long memories begin to forget your ghost and remember your net. There will be consequences in courts and councils, but the city sleeps easier that night, and your own sleep is the first unbroken one you have had since the cutter went down.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Keep your secret and run a cold, perfect operation\", \"text\": \"You keep your jaw set and your past folded under your tongue like a bitter leaf, and you give the captain the crisp facts he demands without the stain of old stories. You speak routes and timings and hand-signal phrases with an efficiency that leaves no room for pity and little room for trust, and you make the plan sing with clean angles rather than muddy truth. You keep Tamas out of the captain’s line of fire and keep yourself out of the Court’s line of hearing, because you tell yourself the city needs action more than absolution. You design redundancies like a rigger who knows ropes rot where the eye glances past, and you insist on code tightness that makes even League veterans swallow their jokes. You will shoulder the private weight and cash it in as vigilance, and you will make the night a whetstone for your resolve instead of a confessional for your throat.\", \"outcome\": \"The ambuscade sets like glass cooling in a mold: precise, silent, and merciless, and for a moment you believe cold is clean. The pirates ride your borrowed Tenth Mouth into a mouthful of hooks and chain, and though two skiffs smash hard enough to bite splinters into their crews, your Dockers’ safety lines pluck three drowning men back into breath and you count that a math worth keeping. Katch nods, grudging and professional, but there is a thinness to his acknowledging glance, as if he smelled something withheld and decided to set it aside for later, carefully wrapped and labeled. Tamas grips your shoulder in a dark corner and thanks you in five careful words that carry more oil than comfort, and he does not ask what else you could have said, because he knows, because he was there when you could have said it. In the quiet after, the city sleeps and your guilt does not; it prowls the rafters of your skull like a lantern moth seeking light, and though no one dead comes knocking, you hear water in your dreams and wake with your hand clawed for a chain. The mission succeeds without public confession, the Lamplands are uncut, and yet you mark the price in the small places where a man’s breath goes shallow when he passes the Bastion.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Widen the net with Dockers’ safety lines and marsh ferries\", \"text\": \"You leave the Bastion with your plan and double back through Chainmouth to the House of Weights, where you rattle the old meteoric slate with your knuckles until Isha’s crew look up and remember why the stone was bought. You petition the Syndicate to muster extra riggers and marsh ferries under loan, not to fight, not to glory, but to stand in the black between boat and death, and you make the case that a city is best measured by how many come home. You send runners to the Saltstep to tap village ferrymen who ride swells like breath, and you ask the Knotted Wives for three coils sung to float a man who is too tired to sing for himself. You show Lantern code in the open to Dockers who have earned it by scar and oath, and you insist the Wardens make room on their gunwales for rescue hands instead of extra pikes. You stretch the plan wide without letting it thin, and you own the risk that wider nets catch more eyes, because you would rather be seen doing good than unseen doing less than you might.\", \"outcome\": \"The docks bloom with quiet readiness: coils pile like sea-snakes asleep, ferries rock with lanterns hooded to finger-width, and riggers tie knots that remember storms. When the blackout curtain falls, it falls onto a harbor laced with safety like a web spun by a patient spider, and when the pirates blunder into Katch’s steel, they find themselves dragged not only by hooks but lifted by hands that refuse to let even enemies sink unnamed. A single Warden slips on a wet plank and goes under, and a marshwife’s coil finds him at the second blink, hauling him up with a breath still inside, and the Bastion’s cheer is ragged and honest. House Saltvein’s watchers mark the unusual muster and twitch like crabs in a bucket, and their report will cause you later trouble in tariffs and talk, but tonight the Lamplands keep their porches and their stories, and the Dockers make a feast from saved bread. Katch grumbles about chaos even as he signs a line in his log that reads fewer dead than expected, and Isha slaps your back so hard your lungs ring, and the League marks a code phrase in their books for labor lights that saved more than cargo. The city learns to see rescue as part of war, not its aftermath, and you feel your father’s name sit a fraction straighter in your chest.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M2\"], \"next\": [\"M4\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"League of Lanterns code-leaf: a pocket primer for reading advanced harbor signals.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"+Small with River Wardens and League of Lanterns.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Coin and Supply\", \"description\": \"5 silver and a flask of high-grade lamp oil.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
