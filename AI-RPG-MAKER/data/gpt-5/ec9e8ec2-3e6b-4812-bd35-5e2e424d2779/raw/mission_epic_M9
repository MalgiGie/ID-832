Lantern oil glows through pearl, and the shells hush and keen in delicate counterpoint as petitioners step onto the salt-etched floor. You enter with oilcloth cradled like a babe, the Nacre Crown wrapped and cool as moonwater, and a folio of rubbed paper and amber-stained tallies that smell of resin and bees. The benches are thick with guild badges and salt-worn hands; the Conclave’s lenses glimmer with rainbows while Glassworkers whisper song-numbers, and across from them stand priests with censer-smoke in their sleeves and Reefkeepers whose palms bear old cut scars. House Saltvein glides in late, their silks crisp as new paper, and Sel Var’s smile is a river mouth that swallows ships. Over it all the Beacon’s distant hum threads like birdsong, shifting colors along the shell-curves as if the city itself has come to listen. The shells cannot force confessions, but they loathe lies, and everyone here has brought a truth they think will save them or a lie they pray will not sing.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Present the recovered Nacre Crown to the Court as evidence of the city's oath heritage.\",\n        \"Submit the Amber Vaults evidence against the altered tariff slabs to the Order of Brine-Scribes.\",\n        \"Argue for a joint stewardship charter over the Beacon and reef-song with Nerey Alis as mediator.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nerey Alis\", \"lines\": \"Marinth Vell remembers in salt and glass, and I am tired of those memories being dragged across a reef until they cut feet that never chose their path. We will hear from every party, and each will feel the shells' breath at their words so no throat forgets who listens. The Nacre Crown will be placed on the stele where touch means oath and oath means weight that even storm cannot lift away, and there it will rest as we speak of heritage and duty. Bring forward the shaved slabs and amber rubbings, and let the Archive mark them in salt so rumor ceases being a net and becomes a ledger. When all have spoken, I will bind a charter like a tide-rope with knots you can count, and if the shells keen while we tie it, we will unlace, confess, and tie again. Remember this: the Beacon sings for all of us, not for one house or one hall; if we tune it to our vanity, the city will go out of key.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sel Var Saltvein\", \"lines\": \"You bring me a crown dredged from a drowned faith and call it a ledger, and I must smile that poetry suddenly thinks it is law. The city eats because caravans run and brine flows, not because a shell is pleased or displeased at a breath’s shape, and my house has tended those channels through famine and flood. If a clerk in my manse shaved a slab, find me the knife and the hand that held it, and I will cut their employment myself and salt the stump so no infection spreads. But do not let spectacle make you forget the desert’s lessons: scarcity is a blade, and careless hands dull it until it cannot cut the bread we need. You speak of joint stewardship; I speak of singular responsibility, of someone answerable when storms take and smugglers gnaw, and I will not put the Beacon’s key on a ring worn by a crowd. Hear me clearly: I will submit to shells and to stele, but I will not bow to a chorus that sings without knowing the price of silence.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isha Brinehand\", \"lines\": \"Scales do not care about poetry either, Sel Var, but they care about fairness, and when they tilt wrong long enough, men drown, and I count the names on my knuckles. We have rubbed the rubbings and counted the counts, and too many slabs from the Amber Vaults were shaved so thin a breath could break them, and every one of those cuts took stew from a child’s bowl in Chainmouth. The Dockers can stomach storms and broken backs if the weights are true, but a lie under the lintel burns like brine in a cut, and it festers the whole harbor. We do not ask to snatch the Beacon like a toy; we ask to stand at the rope with callused hands so when it pulls, all feel the same force and no one falls into the water. Put the Crown on the stele so it can remember us as we remember it, and put our names next to it if the shells hush, because we will be the ones climbing ladders when it cracks. If there is a knife in Salt Gate, then the blade belongs to more than one palm, and I want to see whose hands have no salt on them at all.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Liora Fen\", \"lines\": \"Light is not spectacle to those of us who tune it until it carries memory true, and the Conclave does not come to unmake oaths but to preserve them in forms fire cannot eat. We have lenses that can replay the cadence of a vow so auditors can hear not just syllable but strain, and we offer to pair those records with the stele so salt and light agree like two witnesses. Reef-song is not a toy to us; it is a language we are still learning, and we would learn it with taboos intact, not cut across the spawning beds that keep the city alive. A charter that forbids us to listen makes the Beacon deaf, and a deaf city stumbles into storms without a pilot. We honor Azerene’s shells and the Archive’s slabs, and we ask only that when the shells hush for truth, we be allowed to fix that truth in prisms so no faction can claim the city misheard itself tomorrow.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Orun Shard\", \"lines\": \"Glass grows like coral when coaxed by patient hands, and those hands belong to the Concord that has kept towers standing through four collapses and the Corsair Year besides. We do not seek to own the Beacon’s heart as a bauble; we seek to tend it as a craft, because when an arch cracks, it is our apprentices who wake at midnight to stitch it with resin and song. A joint charter sounds like a chorus, and we are not afraid of singing with others, but let the stanza for maintenance be ours, with the budget and the authority to halt harvests when the sanglass says it must cure. We ask the Faith to set the taboos and the Reefkeepers to guard the seeds, the Conclave to tune the light that warns the harbor, and the Archive to carve the obligations that bind our hands to our claims. Place the Crown where shells can hear, and let it remind us that a city is not made by one guild’s pride but by many hands that know how to share a tool without breaking it. And if a tariff blade cut the workers thin, we will add our song to the keening until the knife is named.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Myris Khel\", \"lines\": \"Azerene listens from the swell and the silt, and the shells here are only her little ears; do not flatter yourselves that you can sing her into forgetting. The Crown remembers oaths older than any of us, and if we lay it on the stele, then every tongue in this room is invited into a covenant with the drowned. The Faith does not forbid learning; we forbid hubris, which is learning that refuses to kneel when the tide says kneel, and we have seen too many bright minds cut the reef to teach it a lesson. Place taboos within your charter like ribs in a body: no reef-song experiments during spawn, no lens tuned on a prayer unless the prayed-for soul consents, no emergency tune that silences the shells. We will witness your new knots and burn brine in our censers for them, but if the shells keen even a little as you tie, you will stop and confess the reason, and you will leave the room lighter than you came or not at all. Remember, when the city lies, the Beacon sings in clear sky, and that song draws storms.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sorev Katch\", \"lines\": \"Order is a chain you test in a gale, and the Wardens are the ones who lean their backs into the winches when everyone else is shouting. I do not care which initials are stamped on the charter so long as the command lines are clear when a pirate flash-lifts the chain or a storm chews a quay, because muddled authority drowns crews. If the Conclave’s lenses record, then copies come to Windward Bastion; if the Concord halts a harvest, they tell us where and when so we can shift patrols; if the Faith declares a taboo, we rewrite the watch bills so no one blunders through a spawning bed in ignorance. As for shaved slabs, we will not be your cudgel in a merchant feud, but we will seize any ledger the Archive marks suspect and hold it in amber until the Court can breathe on it again. Give us a charter with emergency clauses that are not a blank check for some clever deviants to ride the Veiled Current through, and you will find us obedient to shells and stele alike. In return, when lightning walks down the ridge and the Beacon calls for hands, do not ask the Wardens to play second oar to a committee.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tamas Eelwick\", \"lines\": \"I run lanterns and I run quiet, but I will not run from truth when it is needed, and I have brought a slate of code-logs that I would rather sink than fake. In the Amber Vaults two moons ago, I saw beeswax chipped and patched by a hand that knew what it was doing, and the patch matched a brine stamp from last year like a shadow learns your stride one beat late. The tallies on three slabs jumped by a margin even a lantern-runner can count in a dark alley, and those jumps coincided with a sudden sweetness in Salt Gate promises that tasted like someone’s sweat had gone brackish under a false oath. I am no judge, but I have learned to smell lantern oil for water and coin for copper, and these rubbings stink of both, and I have salted my words for the shells to test. I say this knowing House Saltvein can make a ferry vanish and a boy along with it, but I have tied a knot on my door that says I spoke, and my Assembly will sing if I do not come home. Put my slate by the Crown and the stele, and let them all stare at one another until one blushes.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tairn Latch\", \"lines\": \"This isn’t a toy, and those shells don’t care about deserts or reefs or caravans; they care if your mouth makes a shape your heart isn’t ready to hold, and I have brought both hands open to show I am not hiding a knife. The Beacon keened on a clear day because someone lied big enough to tilt the city, and I have seen how a tilted scale can throw a man into a chain and keep him there forever in the names our mothers refuse to carve. My father’s name sits in my bones like a sand-grit I cannot spit, and I am here to keep other names from grinding men down while those with soft hands call it the price of weather. We put our hands on the same glass and swear the same oath: the reef is not a harp, the Beacon is not a throne, and salt is not a cudgel, and if we make it any of these, then Uln will hear and roll, and the marsh will learn what dry really means. Bind stewardships together so no one hand can pull a string until the city sings what they want to hear, and let the Archive carve that knot in salt so even ghosts must read it. Place the Crown where the shells listen, stamp the rubbed figures in the stele, and make a charter with knots we can count aloud, so in a storm, every crew knows which rope to grab and which to leave to the next hand.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Bind the Four Hands\", \"text\": \"You step to the stele and unwrap the Nacre Crown with a care that makes the shells hush, then set it on the salt where it seems to drink the room’s breath without spilling a drop. You propose a charter that seats the Faith of Azerene, the Reefkeepers’ Lodge, the Glassworkers’ Concord, and the Conclave of Prismancers as four co-stewards of the Beacon and reef-song, with Nerey Alis named as the mediator and final tie-break when storms make tempers slap. You lay out a calendar of seasons where each steward’s domain is primary but never sovereign: spawn to the Faith and Reefkeepers, maintenance to the Concord, signaling to the Conclave, and emergency to the mediator. You demand that the Order of Brine-Scribes hold the master copy in salt and that Windward Bastion keep a sealed light-record, so memory cannot be edited by those who own a stronger lamp or a sharper chisel. You finish with a worker’s promise that dock hands will climb and haul when called, if the charter’s knots are carved where all can read them and the shells do not keen even once while the oath is bound.\", \"outcome\": \"The shells hush as Nerey’s stylus scratches, and the Crown gleams like a tide-eye opening and closing on each clause, giving a faint approving click when the mediator’s prerogatives are spoken plainly. The Order of Brine-Scribes accepts your amber rubbings and shaved-slab evidence and salts it into the Archive while Tamas’s slate is copied, and a preliminary writ of seizure for suspect ledgers at the Amber Vaults is signed under the Court’s nacre gaze. The Conclave and the Concord trade wary nods as their spheres are named, and while each chafes at limits, neither can deny the symmetry or the public’s appetite for a rope with four hands on it and a fifth to keep time. The Faith and the Reefkeepers bless the taboo clauses with censer smoke and salt, promising to sing for calm when the city keeps faith, and hinting they will storm the Bazaar with hymns if it does not. Sel Var Saltvein’s smile tightens like a chain under load, and he withdraws without bowing, leaving a messenger to argue footnotes; the shells keen mildly at one of his parting numbers, and the Court marks it for later. When the hearing adjourns, Nerey places a stamped draft of the Beacon Stewardship Charter in your hands as proof of what was agreed, the Wardens open the lower choir to you for a single tuning session under escort, and word spreads that Tairn Latch spoke for a city of many hands.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Light Over Salt\", \"text\": \"You raise the Crown but place it beside the stele rather than on it, and you argue that memory must be caught before it dissolves, so lenses should be the city’s primary witness with salt as corroboration. You lay out a charter that gives the Conclave first authority over reef-song research and Beacon signaling, with the Glassworkers’ Concord as technical co-chair, while making the Faith and Reefkeepers guardians of vetoes during narrow taboo windows. You speak of swift storms and swifter lies and say light can show the pulse of a vow better than stone can, proposing multi-spectrum recordings of every tuning and oath with public replay at the Prism Bazaar. You insist on a legal framework that punishes tampering with light-records as perjury equal to shell-keened lies, and you ask the Wardens to guard lens vaults like armories. You concede that the Crown is heritage, but you frame it as a symbol that should inspire progress rather than anchor it to the seabed of tradition.\", \"outcome\": \"The Conclave’s domes flare softly as Liora Fen thanks you with an academic’s gravity, and Glassworkers murmur that a reliable signal is worth as much as a steady hand, even if their pride prickles at shared primacy. The Faith’s shells hush only reluctantly at your proposal, and Myris Khel warns that light without kneeling is a beacon for hubris, while the Reefkeepers promise to cut lines for any experiment that drifts into spawning song without their leaf-signed leave. The Order of Brine-Scribes accepts the Amber Vaults evidence but etches a dissent on the new hierarchy of proof, agreeing to recognize light-record only alongside salt under the current law; they schedule debates for an annex rather than a replacement. Sel Var Saltvein, reading the room, applauds the efficiency talk while refusing to admit any fault, and the shells give two sharp keens when his clerk recites a cargo figure; the Court takes the hint and sends a Warden to the Amber Vaults. Nerey Alis drafts a charter skewed toward research and responsive signaling with strong penalties for spectral tampering and a clear veto for taboo seasons, and she places a stamped draft in your hands as proof even as a line of priests leaves the hall in cool silence. When the day ends, the lower choir is opened to you for a single supervised tuning while Conclave lenses watch, and your name gathers color among prismancers even as some shells remember your words with a wary hum.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"The Tide’s Oath First\", \"text\": \"You set the Crown dead center on the stele and, without theatrics, kneel so the shells catch every syllable while you ask the room to remember who the sea drowns when pride sings too loud. You present a charter that grants the Faith and the Reefkeepers first and lasting say over reef-song, Beacon rhythms that might stir Uln, and any experiment that grazes taboo, with Glassworkers maintaining under their oversight and the Conclave relegated to advisory roles where prayer has already said yes. You speak of storm-wrath and razor squalls born of overcutting, and you ask the city to treat the reef like the ribs of the sainted coast: sacred structure first, convenience second, profit last. You propose public confession clauses if the shells keen at any point in a meeting of stewards, with mandatory halts and days of atonement before the city can try again, and you request that the Archive etch the confession right next to the order of business. You place the shaved-slab evidence in the Brine-Scribes’ care with a worker’s curse laid on any who try to bribe the process, and you look Sel Var in the eye until he looks away.\", \"outcome\": \"The shells hush like a tide-combed beach after your kneel, and the Faith’s choir breathes a low amen that threads through the hall like fog, settling tempers that had risen to sharp edges. The Reefkeepers’ old scars gleam as they nod, and they lay cut palms on the stele beside the Crown, promising that if the city keeps this order, they will guide every pilot home when storms let them. The Glassworkers accept the maintenance role under taboo oversight, muttering about slowed curing schedules but unable to resist the moral clarity, and the Conclave’s faces turn thoughtful, their praise courteous but their eyes already seeking legal edges to press in time. The Order of Brine-Scribes receives the Amber Vaults evidence with solemn gratitude and sends escorted runners to the Amber Vaults with writs like white knives, while the Wardens post sworn guards at the lens vaults to prevent any quiet adjustments while the city prays. Sel Var’s mouth hardens, and he argues jurisdiction until a shell keens at a trivial arithmetic he tries to slip past, after which he bows with ice in his shoulders and leaves his lawyer to drown alone in procedure. Nerey Alis writes a charter that makes taboo seasons iron, confession clauses mandatory when shells complain, and emergency authority subject to public witnessing; she stamps a draft and places it in your hand, then orders the lower choir opened to you for a single tuning so you can hear how the Beacon hums when a city kneels together.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M8\"], \"next\": [\"M10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Draft of the Beacon Stewardship Charter (proof item)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"+Medium with Nerey Alis and Order of Brine-Scribes; ±Minor with Conclave of Prismancers, Faith of Azerene, and Glassworkers' Concord based on your arguments\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Permission to access the Beacon’s lower choir for one tuning session under Warden escort\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
