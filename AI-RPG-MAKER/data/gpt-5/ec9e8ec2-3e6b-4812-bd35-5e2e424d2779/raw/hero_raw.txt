His father died in the chainjam that birthed Dockers' Weighing Day; his mother and the village kept him fed with eel stews and knot-charity. Tairn trained his hands with ferry-poles, gaffs, and chain-hooks, and grew into the kind of rigger who can shoulder a storm without letting it shoulder him. He stood in the Lamplands during the Corsair Year as a teenage runner, hauling lantern oil and hauling wounded; the shells of the Court keened for his first oath that day, and he kept it: no crewman drowns because a boss shaves a scale. Under Foreman-Keeper Isha Brinehand he learned to turn strength into a shield for others and to make strikes bite without spilling more blood than the tide already claims. A season guarding Salt Gate caravans put Tairn in the orbit of House Saltvein; he saw the Sere Flats glare like knives and learned how tariffs can starve a city as surely as pirates. After a quarrel over brine weights and hush money, he left Saltvein hire, returning to Chainmouth to drill chainhouse rescues and defend pickets. His fighting style mixes chain-hook grapples, ferry-pole sweeps, and tideglass edge-work learned at the Glassblossom Nursery where he helped haul seed panes during the Glass Blossom festival. In recent years Tairn has ferried strike kitchens during shortages, escorted Reefkeepers on spawn patrols when tempers ran hot, and once dove the lip of the Silted Basilica to pull a panicked apprentice from echo-sickness. He reads lantern talk well enough to know when a blackout means mercy or a knife. The city knows him as a straight hitter who takes oaths at the Court of Echoing Shells with his hands open and his jaw set—and as someone who will cross a chain-gate alone if a child is on the wrong side of it when storms rise.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tideglass falchion Chainwake\",\n      \"description\": \"A single-edged, blue-green blade grown in the Glassblossom Nursery and tempered in brine; hums faintly when chain-gates lift or when storms gather.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chain-hook gauntlet\",\n      \"description\": \"Iron wrist-guard with a swivelled hook and tideglass bite-teeth, used to catch links, haul bodies from water, or yank enemies off balance.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shell-stitched brigandine\",\n      \"description\": \"Brine-hardened leather set with nacre plates salvaged after reef storms, flexible on ladders and decks but stubborn against cuts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lantern code-slate\",\n      \"description\": \"A waxed pocket slate scratched with League of Lanterns shorthand, disguised as a tally board; lets Tairn read and answer simple signal phrases.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Knot-charm cord\",\n      \"description\": \"A wrist-wrapped cord tied by the Knotted Wives of Iska, warding drowning and echo-sickness if kept salted and sung to on first tide.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Stormcloak\",\n      \"description\": \"Oilskin cloak beaded with resin droplets that shed spray and sparks; weighted hem prevents wind-flip on open quays.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Fulgurite shard\",\n      \"description\": \"A thumb-length glass tube birthed in the Storm-Kiln Caldera; when clenched during an oath, it warms if the speaker means to keep it.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 16,\n    \"agility\": 13,\n    \"constitution\": 15,\n    \"intelligence\": 11,\n    \"wisdom\": 12,\n    \"charisma\": 10,\n    \"dexterity\": 14,\n    \"endurance\": 16,\n    \"perception\": 13,\n    \"luck\": 9\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Dockside leadership and strike coordination\",\n    \"Lantern and chain-flag signal reading\",\n    \"Marsh navigation and ferry craft\",\n    \"Oath etiquette under the Faith of Azerene\",\n    \"Hard-bargain negotiation at the Prism Bazaar\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Isha Brinehand\": \"Mentor and union chief who pulled Tairn from grief into purpose; she trusts him to hold a line when tempers and tides rise, and he owes her his life for the day she hauled him from a fouled chain.\",\n    \"Sel Var Saltvein\": \"Powerful rival whose tariffs Tairn has publicly challenged; he once took a short loan from Salt Gate Manse to buy medicine for his mother and paid it back with interest, but Sel Var remembers favors and grudges with equal clarity.\",\n    \"Tamas Eelwick\": \"Childhood friend from the eel gardens turned lantern-runner; Tamas ferries messages through the Saltstep and sometimes slips Tairn coded warnings when Wardens or smugglers plan to make trouble near picket lines.\"\n  },\n  \"ambitions\": \"Win a public labor seat on the Trium or force the charter that creates one, weld the River Wardens and Dockers into a single storm-rescue corps with shared safety law, and see the Beacon of Myr Sal held in true common stewardship rather than by uneasy concordats.\",\n  \"flaws\": \"Hot-blooded when scales or oaths are cheated, stubborn to the point of recklessness in rescues, and suspicious of the Conclave’s light-records after seeing illusions used to tilt a wage hearing.\",\n  \"dreams\": \"To raise a tideglass bridge from Glassward to the marsh villages that flexes with the tide so no child has to gamble a night ferry in storm; to carve his father’s name straight into a Brine Archive stele under the heading Saved, Not Lost; to hear the Reef-Mother’s lullaby with his own ears and know Uln sleeps because the city kept faith.\",\n  \"secrets\": \"During a salt strike, Tairn helped the League of Lanterns run a blackout that turned a corsair pack toward a reef and away from the Lamplands; a River Warden cutter wrecked in the confusion and one Warden drowned.
