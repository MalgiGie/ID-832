    "description": "The Saltstep Marsh breathes in the dawn like a patient, and every plankway sighs as the tide lifts its ribs beneath your boots. Lantern smoke and mangrove sap thread the air, and the water holds constellations of fireflies that look like drowned stars refusing to sink. Ahead, the Elder Mangrove of Iska rises in a tangle of roots as wide as keeps and as old as the city’s fear of floods, its resin beading in tear-bright bulbs that glimmer with a light too soft to be only reflection. Men have begun to quarrel for those tears as if they were coins, and when coin commands knives the marsh learns new songs it never meant to sing. House Saltvein guards, brine-backed and brisk as desert wind, have been seen in sacred channels where only Knotted Wives and ferry-folk should pole, and the cutters have learned to count their fingers after every handshake. Myris Khel, the High Censer’s envoy, stands at your shoulder with a censer smoke that smells of salt and lemon peel, and asks for a shield that knows when to be a wall and when to be a door. You are to ferry him to the Assembly landing at Iska’s knee, where the Piledwellers will gather and the Knotted Wives will tie a cord of new law, singing it into the mangrove’s memory so the resin’s flow is taken fair and left fair. If the cord holds wet and the song rings true, even the Trium must walk along its length, and the Brine Archive will etch its twists into salt. If blades or coin try to cut the music, it will be your task to keep hands open and tempers from sparking, to push back with voice before hook and to end any fight with the least blood the tide will allow. Above, the leaves whisper like gossiping elders, and somewhere in their susurrus you think you hear a promise the marsh once made to the city: we will hold you up if you remember how to hold each other.",

            "lines": "The sea keeps balance with teeth as often as with mercy, and we serve both because Azerene smiles on those who remember their oaths even when their hands shake. Resin is a body’s blood and a city’s breath, and when a body bleeds too much it stumbles, and when a city breathes too greedily it coughs up storms. The Knotted Wives will tie law today, and if the cord holds wet and sings straight, even the Trium and the proudest merchant will have to step along its lines as if the river drew them there. I need a shield that knows when to be a wall and when to be a door, because sometimes letting a man pass saves more lives than winning an argument at the point of a hook. Stand with me and listen to the shells of the Court that I carry in this pouch; they keen faintly when lies are near, they hush when the truth is brave, and they remember the voices of those who spoke before us. If blades come, I ask you to put yours down first only if they put theirs down second, because a lowered weapon is a promise only when it is mirrored and not stolen. Trust the marsh to echo back the names of those who wrong it, and trust me to speak for Azerene’s mercy when pride wants to shout."

House Saltvein will come smiling, counting, and daring you to count yourself into their number, and they will call it peace when the scale tips their way. Remember Weighing Day and the iron slate at the House of Weights, and remember how a city stands straighter when its scales are true. If you must push, push like a tide that carries boats rather than a storm that breaks them, because resin and blood both stain wood and the marsh keeps both memories. My union backs this knot-law because the marsh held us when the chains jammed and the city almost drowned, and we owe it more than our tempers and less than our fear. Bring Myris to that landing, keep the singers safe, and if you have to shout, shout for the children who will walk these planks after us rather than for any guild banner that flaps today."

These cords smell of sap and sea because they were steeped in both, and when our song runs through them it will carry the taste of brine on the breath of anyone who lies about what was agreed here. The knots we use are old, Tairn Latch, older than your father’s father and older than the oaths that raised the Beacon, and they tighten when cut, so a blade finds itself biting its own owner. House Saltvein has sent men into channels where only ferries and prayers should go, and their boots have crushed seedlings that would have rooted new homes for crabs and people alike. If they come today, let them see our hands open, our cords bright, and our song loud, and then let them hear the hush that falls when an entire marsh refuses to move for coin. Keep your hook turned downward until it must rise, and if it must rise, let it catch only the wrists that are already reaching for a throat."

The Manse pays for resin boats and keeps pirates from sniffing your scent all the way up the delta, and when your ferries are cut free in a gale, it is often our coin that hires the hands that pull you back. If a knot tells me I cannot take what I bought and bled for, I will cut the knot and blame the tide, and the tide will accept the blame because it has no advocate except the wind. House Saltvein honors contracts written in ink, sealed in amber, and witnessed by men of standing, and I do not bow to cords tied by marsh-wives who answer to reeds and rumors. If the Faith wants law, bring it to the Court of Echoing Shells where nacre masks and salt steles make truth, and we will argue it with judges instead of with songs that no ledger can quote. I say again, stand aside, because I have schedules, quotas, and a matriarch whose patience is shorter than this ferry pole."

Every reed hillside you pass will whisper your name to the egrets, the crocodiles will take your oars for driftwood, and the Bone Bridge will light a path not to your profits but to the mistake you most fear. The Archive will etch this cord after the song, and the Court will keen for anyone who frays it, and I have heard those shells cry loud enough to carry over a storm and make men turn pale. We keep this law or the delta loosens its grip, and then none of us will have piles sturdy enough to stand on when the sea laughs and turns your brine canals to lifelines for strangers. I have worked your caravans and eaten the dust of the Sere Flats, and I know the taste of your tariffs when they press against a poor man’s teeth, so do not talk to me of ledgers as if a ledger were not a knife with a polite handle. Stand down, take breath, and let the marsh speak before your coin does, or you will find your coin buys only apologies and pyres."

I do not come to pick a side today because the Bastion learns caution at the edge of storms, but I come to warn that every man who draws steel here earns the Bastion’s iron in reply. I have men at the chainhouses ready to lift or drop according to signal, and those signals will follow necessity, not anyone’s purse, pride, or prayer. If this knot-law is sung and witnessed by the Faith and etched by the Archive, we will enforce it with the same calm as we enforce a chain-lift, and if it is not, then we will enforce quiet until it can be argued in the Court. I have seen the marsh swallow fools and heroes alike, and I would prefer to carry no bodies today, not yours, not the priest’s, and not a Saltvein hireling trying to impress a matriarch he will never meet. Put your hands down, close your mouths for the length of five breaths, and listen to the old tree that has kept all of us from drowning longer than our lineages remember."

I lit a blue-green on the far spit to slow them with superstition, but men with quotas measure fear and decide they can afford only so much of it. If you want to reach the Knotted Wives unbothered, there is a drift between mangrove knees that hides a boat if the rower knows to breathe with the herons and not with his chest, and I have seen you breathe like that when you carried wounded. The League will not claim we did this, of course, because the Wardens have long ears and the Bastion has long memories, but some lights go out for mercy and not for coin. If you need me, I will be three lantern lengths behind you, ready to throw a shadow where a blade expects a face, and ready to whistle a song that sounds like a storm too far to be real and close enough to make sensible men find shelter."

            "text": "You step between Myris Khel and Serat Voss with your palms bare, and your voice carries along the planks like a ferry bumping every post in greeting. You propose a phased quota, tied to the song’s proof and etched by the Archive, beginning with a gentler draw in spawning months and rising only with the Knotted Wives’ seasons marked. You offer House Saltvein escort privileges on non-sacred channels and a tri-guild watch composed of a Warden, a Docker, and a Lantern to witness every load. You remind them of the Corsair Year and the profit lost when pride bled into the water, and you name the children who would be hungry if the marsh soured and the resin ran bitter. You end with a promise to bring the first disputed jar under the shells of the Court within a day, and you place your fulgurite shard on the plank to warm for truth while you speak. The marsh’s hush after your words feels like a held breath ready to become a song if anyone dares the first note.",
            "outcome": "Serat Voss grimaces, but in the end he nods with the stiff reluctance of a man who has calculated that the loss today is a quieter profit tomorrow, and he accepts the phased quotas with escort privileges and the tri-guild watch. Myris Khel blesses the compromise, and Liora Fen ties a second witness knot around the first cord so the law knows it walked in company rather than in triumph. The Wardens mark the agreement on a slate and the League’s lanterns echo it in color, and the Brine Archive’s runner promises a stele within the week. House Saltvein’s men withdraw with their dignity rattling like coins in a thin purse, and the Assembly’s song rises unbroken, settling into the roots with a sweetness that smells of sap and rain. Reputation shifts as expected: the Faith and the Assembly speak well of your steadiness, while Serat Voss writes your name into a private book of grudges that he pretends not to keep, and the city hears that you solved a storm with a pilot’s hands."

You form a human chain across the channel with ferry-poles braced and hooks pointed groundward, and you invite any man who would trespass to lay his blade on the plank and walk through under the eyes of every grandmother in the village. You speak of the iron slate that straightens scales, and you promise that any man who tries to bend today’s law will find the slate’s ache in his back before the week is out. Your words pull Isha Brinehand’s lessons through your ribs and out your mouth, and the people rise like a tide that has decided it loves the shore too much to retreat. You keep your own temper moored and your hook low, and you name the line not as a wall against House Saltvein, but as a living promise that no song will be cut today, not by coin, not by contract, and not by pride. Even Serat Voss hesitates when he sees grandmothers with knots tied into their sleeves and toddlers tapping the rhythm of the Assembly on their knees.",
            "outcome": "The hirelings step back, cowed by a force no blade can cut without starting a war that their employers would have to finish under the Court’s eye, and Serat Voss chooses not to be the spark that lights that pyre. Myris Khel thanks you and lifts his censer once, twice, thrice, and the shells in his pouch hush so fully you hear your own heart like a drum. Liora Fen sings, and the cord tightens to the mangrove’s slow heartbeat, and the law settles like dew on old leaves. Wardens mark the day as kept without blood, and Dockers tell the story in the House of Weights until men who were not there swear they can still feel the planks humming under their boots. The truce is recognized by Faith and Archive, and while House Saltvein carries away a bruise to its pride, your name grows in the marsh like a pole mark burned into a landing post, firm, weathered, and trustworthy."

You let Myris Khel’s censer smoke be nothing more than an extra thread of mist, and you wrap your stormcloak tighter so the resin’s glow on your shoulders looks like just another ripple. The culvert to the Veiled Current takes you for a breath, and you use it like a stitch rather than a road, popping out two bends from the Assembly while Saltvein’s second crew chases a blue-green decoy that the League set like a fisherman’s lure. You arrive before the trouble can grow teeth, and you help the Knotted Wives set the circle, place the cord, and begin the song before any blade can find a reason to flash. When Serat Voss’s vanguard finally clatters into view, they find the law already tied, the Faith’s stamp cooling on wax, and the Archive’s runner scraping salt as the first lines are etched. You stand with a patient smile that says nothing and everything: they were late because the marsh did not want them to be on time.",

The Wardens, bound by procedure, enforce the freshly tied law, and the hirelings settle into watchful scowls that do not quite hide their relief at the absence of bruises. Myris Khel pats your arm and whispers that mercy often arrives in silence, and Liora Fen winks as she knots a tiny cord around your wrist to thank the boat that breathed like a bird. The Brine Archive’s co-signed quota writ is sealed on the spot, and the Faith’s blessing cord is placed in your hands with sap still drying. House Saltvein leaves vowing appeals at the Court, but the marsh has already drunk the song, and the city will hear that you move like a lantern’s shadow, doing the work while other men argue about the light."

You insist that the cords be tied under the shells’ keen, and that Serat Voss speak his objections into a choir that has no patience for embellished ledgers or trimmed truths. You fetch a portable shell from Myris Khel’s pouch and place it on a plank already salted for oath, and you invite the Knotted Wives to sing into it so the law’s first breath goes straight to judgment. You speak quietly, not to shame, but to bind, and you offer House Saltvein an appeal route carved in salt that no man can accuse of favoritism or sorcery. When the shell hums for truth and keens for lies, you let it tell the story that the marsh told you on the way here: that resin is blood and that knives belong at fish tables, not at law’s throat. The gathered folk, even the hirelings, lean forward because every city ear knows a shell cannot be bribed for longer than a day and today is all that matters.",

The Knotted Wives sing and the shell hums approval, and the Brine Archive’s witness marks the line for a stele that no one will dare scrape thin. The Wardens, respectful and perhaps a little awed, formalize the truce with their own salted signatures, and Myris Khel rubs resin into the shell’s rim until it hushes like a calmed child. House Saltvein takes the truce while swearing to argue tariffs later, and you make yourself the bridge they must cross to do it, promising to show at the Court when called. The law is recognized, the blessing given, and your name gathers weight among oath-keepers even as a fresh shadow gathers under Salt Gate Manse where grudges are kept with careful hydration and little light."
