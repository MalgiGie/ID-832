    "description": "After the last lanterns of the Glass Blossom drift like small suns into the marsh dusk, the Beacon of Myr Sal exhales a steady hum that settles behind the heartbeat like a remembered lullaby. Standing within its ringing ribs of living glass, you feel each tone turn and resolve along the bridges and piles of Marinth Vell, as if the city itself were a harp strung with causeways and chain-gates. The Conclave calls it opportunity, a chance to tune those tones so that oaths can ride them without the keening that strips a liar raw, and to thread warnings through the streets so soft that only the guilty taste iron. The Faith names it temptation, the old sin of presuming a city can be played like an instrument without also calling the sea to dance, and the Reefkeepers murmur that the currents which cradle Uln’s Lullaby are the same veins the Conclave would pluck if their hands stray. Nerey Alis summons you to the Beacon’s choir chamber where prisms spill moonsalt light and storm-etched shells wait on cushions, and she sets before you the last tuning: Liora Fen to the lenses of the Conclave, Myris Khel to the Faith’s keening shells, Orun Shard with the Glassworkers’ tempered panes, and Thalen Marr with a pilot’s ear turned to the hush and surge below. Rumor of the Heartshard curls like smoke at your ankles; some say a fragment of night hammered by gods rests somewhere beneath the spire, stolen long ago and hidden like a loaded vow. If it is seated wrong, the Beacon could become a bell that wakes a sleeping leviathan or invites every oath to turn into a chain. If it is sealed away, the city must lean harder on shells and charters, on names carved into salt and not sung into light. Tonight you must decide how the chords sit, whose hands hold which ties, and whether Sel Var Saltvein will set her seal beside the Faith, the Conclave, and the Guild to share stewardship of the Beacon so it remains a light that guides children home instead of a throat that shakes the deep.",

I have watched guilds and priests circle this tower like kites around a single fish, and I have watched you hold lines when storms worked at your bones. This is not a question of whose anthem carries, but whether the chords we bind here travel clean along bridges and do not dive into the sea to wake what should sleep. I need you to listen, to ask where the edges are soft, and to set terms that even a rival will keep when the tide turns. When you put quills to charter, know that I will sign what you can make stand in a storm, and I will carry it to the Court of Echoing Shells myself if that is what it takes to settle the city’s breath."

It will not command, and it will not pry; it will be a consonance that brushes the tongue of those who shape falsehood until their own teeth tattle with a ringing they cannot ignore. We will set shutters of light that close at the harbor lip and hush at the marsh’s edge, so the Reef-Mother’s song is untouched and Uln dreams on. Our lenses will live in the public ribs of the tower, engraved with sigils of oversight that require hands from Faith and Guild to alter, so no child with lenses could swing this city into a tyrant’s bell. Give me this trust, and I will spend it like a miser in the wet winter of a famine, and I will let your Dockers’ slate weigh upon my work until even the shells nod and hush at its truth."

The shells keen for lies because we ask them to, and because we treat them as witnesses, not instruments, and that boundary matters more than our comfort with quick certainties. A shard in the root is power in a dark cupboard, and power left in the dark grows hands no one accounted for when the charters were drafted. If we must bind this hum, bind it to warning and remembrance, not to binding tongues; let the Crown of Nacre stand for oaths and let the Court remain the place where truth and consequence meet in public light. If you keep faith with that balance, Tairn, then the sea will see we have not forgotten to bow when we ask her patience, and the shells will hush instead of keen when we speak."

The Heartshard, if it is real and not a tale told to sell lantern oil on cold nights, would seat into the root with a hunger, and hunger in glass means stress in arches and splinters in song. We can temper the hum with resin and careful brine, braided with the guild’s old work songs, so it carries comfort to roofs and warnings to chainhouses without drawing the deep to listen. Give the Guild a hand on any tuning lever and a lock that no single craft can turn, and I will stand in public and say the Conclave does not own this throat and the Faith does not bind it shut. Keep the shard sealed, or keep it cradled where it cannot slip into the structure, and I will put the Concord’s seal beside yours on the charter and sleep under its shadow without waking to check for cracks."

Currents carry more than boats, and a tone that seems to die at the chain-gates can travel on a rain of bubbles that even pilots do not see until nets come up full of silence. If you let the Beacon hum about oaths, you must fix its shore and teach it to forget the sea; give it a habit of hushing when the reef breathes and of bowing to spawning tides. I want closures written into the charter that let Wardens and Reefkeepers shutter the tone during the Lullaby’s season, with penalties that bite if any guild refuses. Agree to those, and I will teach the city a counter-song that makes the hum kneel at the harbor lip and return home like a well-trained boat."

A three or four-way lock on this Beacon’s workings I can live with, because a balance of hungers makes a fair table and because shared custody breeds compromise instead of coups. Seat a shard in the root and call it stewardship, and you will find creditors in the reef and debt collectors in the storm, and you will come to my door expecting charity when the bill bites. Seal the chamber and write that any tuning must be witnessed where shells can keen, and I will give you my seal and my guards to carry the pages through any angry crowd. Do not ask me to trust a secret in a place where even the floor remembers every foot that crosses it, and do not expect me to weep when an experiment drowns a district if I warned you the tide was turning."

This tower was grown from a song that saved our lives, not from a wish to make our tongues obey, and I will not turn it into a pipe that whistles obedience across roofs like a master calling dogs. We can tune for comfort, for warnings that kiss windows and let mothers know when to gather children from walkways, and we can keep the law where it belongs, in shells that keen in public and in charters carved where salt does not burn. If there is a shard below, we will seal it with witnesses and set a watch to check the seal at every festival so no secret grows legs. Put your names together with mine and Nerey’s and the Dockers’ hot-tempered marks and the Reefkeepers’ careful cuts, and we will hold this rope together until even the sea agrees it is tied true."

            "text": "You descend with witnesses to the root chamber and set the rumored fragment not into the living ribs but into an amber cradle that kisses the Beacon’s foundation without biting it. You bind it with a five-hand lock whose keys rest with the Faith, the Conclave, the Glassworkers, the Reefkeepers, and the Harbormistress, and you etch in salt the rule that no two may turn it alone. You return above and command a tuning that threads only the city’s bones, hushing at the harbor lip and dying at the marsh’s edge, and you test it by speaking a practiced half-lie that makes your teeth sing until you spit. You have Liora draft light-seals that show in the Prism Bazaar for any citizen to inspect, and Myris lays shells in a circle so that any change to the chord must be confessed where the Court can hear it. You tell the city that the shard is not a master’s rod but a held ember, useful when the air freezes but deadly if hugged for warmth in summer.",
            "outcome": "The Conclave glows with triumph yet bows to the locks you demand, and the Faith frowns but allows that a light shown in public is a lesser sin than a whisper in the dark. The Reefkeepers test the harbor lip with counter-songs and find the hum kneels like a trained boat, though Thalen warns that in certain fogs it tastes like iron and should be shuttered. Orun Shard pronounces the stresses acceptable and sets a team to listen for hairline whines that would betray a crack, promising a strike if any tuning is attempted without his hand. Sel Var Saltvein signs, pressing a ring into wax so deep the seal pops when it cools, and she extracts a clause that fines any steward who uses the shard during spawn closures. The city learns a new courtesy: when a lie tries to form, a mouth closes and a hand lifts to ask for shells, and the Beacon hums like a hearth that remembers storms without inviting one."

You read aloud the Faith’s Old Tying verse, and you press your fulgurite shard until it warms, promising that no voice will ever wake in the Beacon to call a soul a liar. You order a tuning that lays over roofs like a hand ready to shake a shoulder, a gentle alarm that rises for fire, flood, and chain-jam, and that falls quiet at the first line of a hymn to Azerene. You etch at the Court of Echoing Shells the rule that oaths remain the province of nacre and breath, and you invite the Conclave to build lenses that bend light for comfort and guidance, not command. You stand in the Prism Bazaar and say into full spectrum that the city prefers its truth in the open, and the shells hush so long that children giggle and then go solemn when they realize that silence is the sound of trust kept.",

The Conclave bows with theatrical grace and asks for a place in the charters that lets light-archives sit beside salt steles as testimony to warning and memory, and you grant them a clause that makes light a lantern to law, not its replacement. The Reefkeepers send smoke and song from outer rocks and smile when the hum shies from the reef like a boat that knows its depth, and Thalen confides that Uln sleeps deeper for the quiet. Orun Shard signs for the Glassworkers with hands dusted in brine, promising to keep the Beacon’s ribs tuned to carry warmth on cold nights and to hum softer in heat to spare the old their dreams. Sel Var Saltvein writes her name with a small flourish that concedes nothing of pride but much of prudence, and she leaves with a charter that will stand in courts and storms alike."

You declare the shard a city relic, not a mechanism, and you house it not in the Beacon’s root but in a transparent reliquary in the Court of Echoing Shells, chained by law to the Beacon with an oath-cord that only the Court can knot. You write that only during corsair siege, flood collapse, or caldera failure may the emergency bell be rung, and only with a supermajority of stewards and the shells’ hush. You tune the Beacon to carry routine warnings and festival songs, and you teach a counter-hum that citizens can sing from windows to still its voice if they fear it has strayed. You end the night by lighting Azerene’s candles along the chainhouses, letting their drift mark a new custom: the city will hear itself, but only as loudly as it dares to be honest.",
            "outcome": "The Conclave grumbles and then smiles when they realize an emergency bell places their craft in public theater where their pride is safest from itself, and they promise to build a lens that can be seen from the marsh to signify when the bell is legally lit. The Faith accepts the compromise because the shells keep the key and the bell rings only when law and sea harm agree to its need, and Myris leaves a string of blue beads on the reliquary as a warning against casual hands. The Reefkeepers agree to a clause that grants them veto during spawn or lullaby nights, and Thalen offers to carve a pilot’s knot into the oath-cord so it can be cut in a heartbeat if ever it snarls. Orun Shard drafts maintenance rites that make emergency readiness a shared chore, so the Guild’s apprentices learn the law alongside heat and brine, and he promises to strike if anyone uses the bell to ring wage threats. Sel Var signs because she understands disaster and debt both, and because the reliquary’s glass will show every thief who tries to pocket a future summons."

You ask Sel Var to stand under the nacre choir and to speak her fears aloud, and you answer with the stubborn courtesy of a rigger who has hauled too many bodies to waste breath on threat. You offer tariff transparency around Beacon maintenance and a public ledger for any shutdowns ordered during spawn, so labor and merchant both can prepare without rumors burning hotter than oil. You ask for her seal in return for clauses that punish blackouts used as political cudgels, no matter who orders them, and you promise that Wardens, Dockers, and Lanterns will share rescue drills under the Beacon’s new warning hum. You make the bargain large enough that winning no longer looks like someone else’s loss, and the shells hush until even quarrelers feel the relief of a fair weight laid on both sides of the scale.",
            "outcome": "Sel Var tastes the air like a merchant at the Sere Flats testing for a salt storm, and then she nods because the ledger you offer is a mirror she believes she can live inside. She signs without being cornered, which means she does not sharpen knives for your ribs on her way out, and she starts boasting that she saved the city from a bell built in secret, which is a boast you can afford. The Faith approves of the method as much as the matter, and Myris says that oaths made under the shells are oaths that keep better when storms lean. The Conclave finds themselves bound to report tune-changes in public, which stings them into better craft instead of slyness, and Liora surprises herself by thanking you with a bow a little lower than pride usually allows. The Reefkeepers watch the Court doors like pilots watching weather, and Thalen claps you on the shoulder because a bargain made in the open is a current that can be read by any sailor who cares to look."
