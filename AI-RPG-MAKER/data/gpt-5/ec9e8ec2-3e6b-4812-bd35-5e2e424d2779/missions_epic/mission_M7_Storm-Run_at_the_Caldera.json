    "description": "Half a day upriver, where the hills split like knuckles around an old wound, the Storm-Kiln Caldera crouches and breathes. The air tastes of coins and rain, and every ridge-road shines with glassy scabs where lightning knelt and taught the sand to remember. Tideglass spires rise from the basin like frozen songs, their skins webbed with fulgurite veins that hum when clouds mass and argue above. On this rare day, the Conclave of Prismancers and the Glassworkers' Concord have agreed to sing the furnace as one, pooling choir and craft to coax a growth run that could tune the Beacon for a season and hush its anxious keening. But tools have gone missing on the Shoals, resin feeds have coughed without cause, and in the gullies beneath the tallest spire, silhouettes move with the patience of debt-collectors. Liora Fen asks you to be the arm and anchor while tempers and storm surge, to catch any hand that would smash a mold or poison a feed, and to listen for a darker rumor: that a sliver of the Heartshard—the night-stone hammered here by gods or liars—has been stolen away. Fulgur sprites skitter, nibbling at buckles and blades, and the storm rehearses its steps along the ridge while Serat Voss watches from the ash-slope with eyes that measure ruin by the wagon. If the run holds, the Beacon will sing blue and the city's nerves may unknot; if it fails, the Harbor of Nine Mouths will count itself one mouth short of breath.",

The hymns we sing here are not to gods, however much the Faith scowls and pinches their shells, but to lattice and discipline and the patience of heat, and the glass listens the way a child listens when you lean close and tell a dangerous truth. Tools have been walking away on their own legs, and that means someone has been lending them knees, so I need you to stand where theft turns to accident and make the choice too hard. If there is a shard of anything like a heart hammered into this place, it is the habit of oath and storm agreeing to step at the same time, and I intend to keep that habit breathing even if the sky forgets its lines. Keep saboteurs from breaking our rhythm, keep the resin sweet, and keep the molds whole, and in the hush between strikes I will show the Reefkeepers and the Dockers both that we can tune stone without cheating a tide or a wage."

            "lines": "You stand with singers, chainman, but remember whose salt buys the silence that lets them be heard. Lightning is a tax everyone pays, and some of us are simply better at collecting its receipts, so don't look at me as if profit were a poison when you drink safe water bought with it. You don't own lightning, prism-spinner, and you don't own storm, glasswright, and you, Tairn, don't own the righteous plank you like to stand on; you trap a moment and sell it, and I am here to make sure the price lands where my employers can count it twice. You like to stand between guilds like a piling in current, a marsh lad dreaming of bridges, but pilings rot from the inside when the river finds the seam, and I have seen stronger men than you turn to sponge while smiling. Mind your hook and your heroics, because if you fall today I will buy your debt at auction and make a chain of it, and the city will call that mercy because the storm won't bother to bid at all."

We count on three and sing on the seam; if the resin stutters back at you, you backflow the feed and you do not cough in your mask unless you want your lungs varnished, and I have seen that end and it is not pretty. Tairn, keep your hook ready for the kind of man who believes glass is more honest than law, because he will show you a clean shard and ask it to cut a truth that does not belong to him. It isn't more honest, no; it is just less patient, and clean cuts bleed fast while messy ones teach you what the wound is for. Fulgar sprites love a loose buckle, and saboteurs love a man who is watching lightning instead of shadows, so set your eyes where the storm is not and you will catch both."

            "text": "You move where muscle matters most: into the scream and steam between resin vats and fulgurite molds, laying your hook across valves and your voice across tempers. You set Dockers' hand signals with Lantern code-slate flickers so Concord apprentices and Conclave chanters can share a language without stopping their work. When resin threatens to burp and foul a line, you shoulder the pipe with your stormcloak hissing, and you bark the count that gets three guilds breathing together as if they were one chest. Saboteurs test the margins, a sliver at a time, but you are already there, staring back with tideglass eyes that say today is a bad day to pretend gravity forgot to work. Twice the sprites bite at your gauntlet and twice you feed them sparks off a tossed nail, and by the time the ridge lights white, the work gangs are a circle no knife can step through without coming out smaller.",
            "outcome": "The molds hold, the feeds run clear, and when lightning walks down like a patient teacher, the glass rises in the mold with a sound like a promise finally believed. Liora Fen's choir catches the overtone and the Concord croon wraps it warm, and the Beacon far away turns its head as if noticing a familiar scent, humming the same color you see in rain running off slate. Two would-be saboteurs, knifemen with resin-stung eyes, find your hook first and your knee next, and they sleep in ash until Wardens arrive to cuff them, swearing at ghosts they claim gave orders. In the chaos of success, you catch a whisper among the apprentices about a missing shard box that was never logged, and that rumor tastes like the Heartshard, but the storm's cadence will not release you to chase it yet. When the run ends, the crews nod as if handed bread, Liora promises your brooch and chit with a wry smile, and Serat Voss counts your choices and files away a dislike you can feel scratch your back like sand."

            "text": "You leave the hot circle of work and slip along the caldera's scabbed lip where broken glass crunches like stale salt under your boots. Lantern code from a distant outpost blinks a private warning—Tamas Eelwick's pattern for beware—and you tuck that into your pocket like a knife. In the lee of a fulgurite fang, you find footprints too careful and a resin-scent that never belonged to honest work, and your hook knows the weight of a trap before your eyes do. You breathe once to set your balance and then break the blind at a sprint, a ferry charge down a dark pier, and your shoulder meets a saboteur's spine with the news that the day has an editor. His partner draws something that hisses in the storm-scent—an ampoule meant to sour a feed—and your gauntlet closes on his wrist like a chain-house brake on a runaway drum.",
            "outcome": "The fight is quick and exacting, your blade a short blue line and your feet a map of ladders and decks, and when it ends there is only hard breath and a wider silence. You find fulgurite mold-smasher tools wrapped in oilcloth and a satchel of resin salts that smell wrong, heavy with poison meant to make the glass remember badly. In the satchel’s lining is a token pressed with the Salt Gate Manse lintel motif and the signature twist that Serat Voss uses when he wants to sign without admitting he can write, and the evidence burns your palm hotter than the ash. You could haul the men into the work circle and set the truth singing in the Court's key, but the storm is counting again and you can only stash them in a chain recess with knots that hold and return to the run. When Serat Voss's eyes find you later, they flicker with the calculation of a debt gone sour, and whatever small favor he might ever have pretended to you is now salted underfoot; the crews, however, work without fear of shattered molds, and the Beacon will taste that steadiness."

With Liora’s leave and Orun’s grunt, you kneel at a resin pool whose skin shivers with the storm's rehearsal and lay your knot-charm cord along the rim as if teaching it the shape of home. You hum a marsh lullaby the Knotted Wives taught children when fever ran green in the blood, and under it you braid the three-note call the Reefkeepers use to guide the razor eels away from nets. The sprites gather, hungry little sparks with teeth, and you offer them a bargain of bright nails and a shiny buckle to herd them where their mischief can do no harm. Around you, the choir adjusts by a breath, the glass takes the lull, and the molds fill as if soothed by the notion that promises can be kept even when thunder is listening.",
            "outcome": "The fulgar sprites settle onto the decoy nails with the contentment of cats finding a warm sill, and the resin feeds stop twitching as if they were nerves remembering an old pain. Liora’s eyes widen with the kind of delight scholars try to hide and fail, and Orun gives you a nod like a door opening a thumb's width in a street you thought was closed. The storm lands its strokes where invited and not where feared, and a curious harmony slips between Conclave chord and Concord hum as if they had always been meant to share one breath. In the stillness between peals, a thin hairline ring arises on the tallest spire, a sound that glass makes when it misses a friend, and you realize it is the basin itself asking after the Heartshard. The work completes with fewer burns and no spills, and though Serat Voss marks your influence with a narrowing eye, the crews remember your song and will answer when you raise your hand at a quay or court."

            "text": "You choose the shadowed stair that spirals into the spire’s foot, where heat pulses like breath and old fulgurite grows in ribs that resemble the inside of a throat. Every step tastes of vows and smoke, and you know, in the way a ferry knows a current, that this is where the city keeps the part of its voice it does not teach to children. The passage opens into a kilnroom nobody claims, and in the ash you find a box-print with the dimensions of a Conclave shard-case and boot-scuffs that try too hard to forget themselves. The walls sing quietly of oaths taken and unmade, the kind of music that pulls splinters of memory loose, and when you press your fulgurite shard to your palm it warms as if to warn you someone lied here. Above, the run begins to count without you, thunder setting the pace of work you have chosen to risk, and you must decide whether the rumor that brought you here now deserves your whole breath.",
            "outcome": "You follow the scuffs to a maintenance slit where only a desperate courier would crawl, and in the grit you find a sliver of night-glass that eats color from the air, a shaving too true to have been coaxed by any kiln. It hums against your callus like a heart that does not need flesh, and for a moment you see chain-gates lifting in unison and a city that does not forget, and you understand why thieves would brave lightning for a shard’s promise. You wrap it in resin cloth with hands that understand both salvage and sacrament and climb, legs burning, to rejoin a run already singing your absence. You arrive in time to pull a stuttering feed back into tempo, to set a mold straight with your weight, and to catch Orun’s glare melting into gratitude; later, you set the sliver into Liora’s keeping under an oath you speak with open hands. The run’s edge frays but does not tear, the Beacon will still drink good sound, and Serat Voss watches with the expression of a man who has just watched a coin fall between planks, while you carry the knowledge that the Heartshard has indeed been touched and found thinner in the world than it was at dawn."
