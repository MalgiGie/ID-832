    "description": "Under Salt Gate Manse, the brine canals breathe like sleeping snakes, scales of salt slicking the walls where the city's oldest bargains were once whispered into wet stone. Lantern glow stains the underslung arches the color of tea as tide-sighs drift through culverts cut before anyone living remembered why they were measured so precisely and sealed with resin that still smells of sun and lemons. You feel the Veiled Current below the floor like a cat's purr under boards, a hidden throat that opens if you know the patient moment and the right stone to press with a knuckled oath. Tamas comes to you with a code on his slate that flickers in five strokes and a hush: a midnight transfer, a hull that will never stand customs, a promise that the secret culvert you swore to keep has been turned into a river-road for contraband and perhaps for captains who call themselves free of any law but storm. The city's breath is short under tariffs and threats, and secrets that once saved lives now weigh like anchors as pirates skirt the chains and hungry mouths chew bitter eel. You gather a small crew that trusts your knots and your temper, and you wet your fulgurite with a breath that tastes of copper, remembering the oath you kept when the shells first keened for you. The plan is lean and merciless as a chain-link: slip in by the marsh-side grate where reeds comb the current, walk the ribs of the underfloor past guards whose sweat turns brackish every time they mouth a false purity under the manse lintel, and decide, at the crux, whether to drag the tunnel into light or use it as a blade in the dark to cut Serat Voss's dealings to the bone without starving the city. The tideglass sings faint and the walls hum with old prayers; the salt here remembers, and it will remember you.",

        "Enter the Salt Gate Manse culverts via the marsh-side grate without raising an alarm, moving under reed-shadow and along bone-walks that flex to the tide.",
        "Gather proof of clandestine transfers between the culvert and the Veiled Current eddy, such as marked crates, coded lantern slats, or a ledger sealed in resin.",
        "Confront Serat Voss in the brine rooms and force a confession or secure his ledger, binding the truth to salt or to ink that cannot be denied."

            "lines": "I dragged lantern oil through these tunnels when we were boys, and back then a blackout was a magic trick to us, not the blade it becomes when a city forgets its promises. The mark you showed me is still there, tucked under the lip of the third culvert stone like a fish's eye, and the Current still licks at the foundation like a dog that knows where scraps fall. The code I caught out by the reeds was careful, but not careful enough, and when the colors slipped I tasted panic, the kind smugglers wear when Wardens drill too hard and pirates ask for a discount. If we do this, Tairn, we can't pretend we didn't, because once we set a lantern to this throat the light will keep burning in talk and rumor long after we douse the flame. The city won't let us put the secret back in our pockets, and maybe it shouldn't, but I keep thinking about the families who only breathe easy when salt prices don't jump like hooked fish. Your chain-hook saved me once in a churned channel, and I'm asking you to set it again, this time into the ribs of a lie that grew fat in the dark. We go quiet, we go clean, and if we must shout, we shout with shells instead of knives, because I am too tired of bleeding truth piecemeal into water."

            "lines": "You want counsel, boy, then hear me plain and with your mouth shut so your temper doesn't run ahead of your boots. Saltvein's underfloor smells of old sweat and old math, and both will stain you if you roll in them, so you keep your hands open and your eyes on the measure. The Dockers don't need another martyr; we need the kind of proof that stands in daylight when the shells sing and the judges can't pretend they didn't hear. If Serat Voss is running contraband through a culvert, he is doing it because someone promised him he could shave truth and still be paid in clean coin, and that promise will have a name and a tally. Bring me a ledger with lines straight enough to cut your thumb, or bring me a confession so salty it makes the court cough, and I'll turn it into a berth for our people where no private lock can bite. But if you go down there just to feel brave in the dark, I will personally tie you by the belt to the iron slate until your spine learns what balance feels like again."

            "lines": "You're brave down here, where the walls whisper your name back to you until it sounds like something older than your mother could speak without crying. I don't mind that kind of courage, because books are brave too, and I keep ledgers straight enough to slice paper cuts on men who think they're clean. Sometimes straight lines find underground rivers because the surface is crowded with fools who keep tripping over their own virtue, and I prefer quiet water to a stage. You want my book, then take it with your eyes open and understand every entry is tied to a ration that kept a child from chewing bark and a grandmother from boiling belt leather into soup. You pull one line wrong, and your hero's rope becomes a noose for someone who never learned to swim, and the Wardens will say they warned you while they polish their stormglass and practice their grief. Still, I see the hook in your hand and the oathstone at your throat warming like a good coal, so let's talk trade: you swear by Azerene's hush to read before you shout, and I will open a brine room lock that hasn't opened for anyone without my ring in seven years. If you came for blood, you'll get salt instead, and it stings the same, but it also heals if you don't rub your eyes with it."

            "lines": "If I find you under the manse without a writ, I am obligated to weigh you like any other cargo, and believe me, I know how much trouble weighs when it drips. The Wardens earned the right to guard these chains with drills under lightning until our ears rang clean for a week, and I will not watch a crew of lantern-runners and dockers turn the underfloor into a parade. That said, I am not blind to the whispers that slip through our own chainhouses, and even a captain must admit that not all strings pulled in salt belong to smugglers. Bring me a ledger I can't ignore or a confession that makes the shells purr for truth, and I will show you the kind of cold mercy that keeps a city from locking every gate until the harbor turns to still water and the fish rot. But if this is another strike dressed in a saint's robe, you'll find my patience shorter than the distance between a match and an oil slick."

The ledger goes to the Archive if it comes to my hand, and the shells will do what they were built to do while my fulgurite warms or chills according to the truth we lay under it. If you did good with dirty hands, Serat, the shells will hush and your lines will stand, but if you hid knives in sacks of grain or salted the scales with pirate coin, they will keen until the judges' sandals soak through and I won't need to raise my voice to make the city hear. Tamas, keep your lantern low and your courage high; Isha, I will bring you proof that doesn't bruise when you press it. And Captain Katch, if I step wrong, measure me and dock me, but until then don't mistake quiet for consent, because the tide doesn't argue when it rises; it simply lifts what floats and drowns what insists on being heavier than truth."

You gather witnesses from the Dockers, a scribe from the Brine Archive, and a junior priest from the Faith to set shells humming while fog still pearls the chain-gates. The plan is not elegant, but it is honest: seize Serat Voss in the brine rooms, force him to speak under the lintel where lies taste of brackish sweat, and lead him through Chainmouth with the city watching. You practice the oath once in the dark so that your voice will not fail when the shells listen, and you brief your crew on how to keep blood off stone because spilled blood is a lazy argument. When the moment comes, you step forward not as a thief of secrets but as a ferryman of truth, prepared to pay the fare in reputation and risk.",
            "outcome": "The Faith's shells hush and then boom with a clean tone as Serat Voss breaks, his confession salted and sealed by the priest who holds the censer steady despite his shaking hands. House Saltvein howls, and the River Wardens bristle, but the Brine Archive etches the words before fury can rewrite them, and a berth concession at Salt Gate is wrested into public hands as part of the penitent's terms. Dockers and Lanterns raise you on shoulders in the Prism Bazaar that evening, though you keep your feet moving because victory attracts knives, and your name rides rumor like a gull. Pirates feel the chains bite tighter and slip farther to sea, and the culvert's mouth is bricked with glass and prayer where the city can see it. Your standing rises with the Dockers’ Syndicate and the League of Lanterns while House Saltvein's favor cools to salt-rime, and you carry the weight of a new habit—speaking loud enough to be heard by those who would rather the tide stayed silent."

            "text": "You choose subtlety, because a loud truth can stampede a hungry city, and a quiet truth can be knotted carefully around the right throats. In the culvert's breathing dark, you slip past guards and lift Serat Voss's ledger from its resin box, leaving in its place a shard that will hum to you through the night if the book moves. Tamas leads a sting along the Veiled Current using coded lantern veils, and you steer a smuggler's hull straight into a net of Wardens who think they set it themselves. With proof in hand and captains in irons, you walk to the Brine Archive under no banners, just the steady tread of a man who knows papers can be heavier than chains. The city wakes to outcomes, not spectacle, and you let gossip fill the spaces you left empty with a patience that stings your temper but spares your people.",
            "outcome": "The Order of Brine-Scribes receives the ledger, weighs it in salt, and sings witnesses to each entry until the shell choir purrs with certainty; when the warrants descend, they land like rain that has been brewing for weeks. Serat Voss vanishes from the brine rooms and reappears before the Court of Echoing Shells, where he finds that the only bargains left to him are how loudly he will be heard and how much he will name. The Trium cannot ignore the paper storm, and to manage the strain they grant the Dockers a small berth concession at Salt Gate for public use while scolding no one in particular for letting rot creep into the floorboards. The League of Lanterns marks your lantern-code as a thing worth learning, and the River Wardens, though prickly, accept the arrests without an inquest that would stain everyone. Your reputation swells with the Dockers and Lanterns and shrivels with House Saltvein, who begins to look at you as a rock that refuses to be rolled."

You press him for immediate tariff relief and a public berth concession that cannot be clawed back, and you lay your knowledge of the culvert like a whetstone under his words. He resists, then calculates, then sweats, tasting his own brine as his lies evaporate in the heat of the moment, and in the end he agrees to face the shells to bind his promises where even his masters must hear. You walk him to the Court before dawn, not with chains but with a crowd of witnesses who will remember the shape of this choice better than any transcript. It is a gamble that trades spectacle for structure, trusting that a confession can build a bridge where a purge might only smash planks.",
            "outcome": "Under the nacre masks and the listening shells, Serat Voss swears a confession that names the culvert, the captains, and the clauses that bled the poor, and the Faith seals it with a breath that tastes of smoke and salt. As part of the bound remedy, the berth concession at Salt Gate is set aside for public use under Dockers’ stewardship, and tariffs ease like a receding tide over cracked steps. The League of Lanterns marks your prudence in their coded books, noting your preference for knots that hold over knives that flash, while House Saltvein's regard curdles into a quiet, calculating hate. The culvert is placed under civic custody rather than bricked, to be used for storm-rescue and sanctioned relief runs, and you win allies among Wardens who appreciate leverage that does not break bone. Your reputation tilts toward the Dockers and Lanterns and away from House Saltvein, yet you sleep with one eye open, because mercy breeds grudges as often as gratitude."

You wire resin charges along stress lines you read by fingertip and song, and you plan a timed flood that will roar when the tide turns and drown the smugglers' rendezvous before it begins. The operation requires a rescue, because not every guard down here chose their post, and you refuse to risk hands that never touched a ledger. You brace your crew for a sprint through rising brine, prepared to carry those who cannot run, and you write your name on a shard in case the Basilica's silt takes you. When the signal comes, you touch flame to resin with a prayer you learned as a boy for when boats must be sunk to save a village.",
            "outcome": "The culvert shudders like a dying eel and then roars as water eats its spine, and the Veiled Current stutters, throwing smugglers wide of their mark; you haul two coughing guards up by the belts and slam a door against a wall of white where a hall used to be. Serat Voss rages at the ruin, but when the debris settles there is enough wet paper and stamped seals to sketch his wrongdoing, and your testimony under the shells stitches the outline into a confession he cannot wriggle free of. The Dockers win the promised berth concession as part of a rushed settlement to keep cargo moving, and the League of Lanterns chalks your name under a symbol for necessary darkness. House Saltvein marks you for reprisal, not because you lied but because you refused their geometry, and your friendships in Chainmouth become moorings you must tend. The city breathes deeper for a week, and then normal storms return, but the memory of the roar stays in the stones, and so does your reputation: lifted with Dockers and Lanterns, lowered with Saltvein until ice forms between your names."
