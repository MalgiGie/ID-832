A childhood spent ferrying grain on reedboats made him a careful listener—he could hear when sluice-gates were about to complain or when the aqueduct’s whisper meant silt trouble. He earned a place in the Aethral Archive as a copy-lad for tide charts and learned to read water testimony alongside marginalia of old lenswrights. The Hall of Subtle Artifice noticed his knack for harmonics; Master Dorn Rigger took him in to help tune tide-horns and to test safer calibration for aetheric lamps. Thalen refused Mistress Kelen Prism’s push toward a citywide focusing ring, siding with Dorn’s caution after a trial at Shattermere cracked a plate into razor petals. Drawn to the Choir of Silt’s ethics, he became an unaffiliated water-mage who arbitrates in the Temple of the Tidemother when tides permit and crawls Moonhook caverns when they do not. He once rode a Tidewarden skiff through the Elder Chain Shoals during a dead calm, finding a resonance that let them pass a rust-tide alive—an act Commodore Jath Pell has not forgotten. Later, during a brittle standoff between the Blue Fist and harbor patrols, Thalen damped a horn-drill with a silt-bell so talks could proceed; Boss Kema Hookhand accepted terms without blood. Now whispers of a cracked lens under the Sapphire Diadem, Ledger bleed-valves in the aqueduct, and a Choir rite to still the Blue Maw have pulled Thalen into the braid of power. He believes the sea and river can be reconciled—if the city survives its own reflections.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Third-Tone Silt-Bell\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm bell tuned to the aqueduct’s warning register.

Thalen also discovered a hidden bleed-valve on the aqueduct and uses it on moonless nights to top terrace cisterns, leaving the Ledger’s flow ledgers subtly wrong. Years ago he cast a promise into the Blue Maw to ‘bring the city to stillness when the bells demand’—if he refuses, he believes the sea will collect.\"\n}"
