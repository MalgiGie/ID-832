    "description": "Up the Whispering Aqueduct's spine, the Sunken Steppe Terraces lift their faces toward the river like hungry children. The bell-strings have been cut in the night before a weighing festival that will call the River Judge, an old rite that measures a city's debts in water. Rae Fen asks you to secure the lines, defend the bell-ringers, and bring the truth of the bleed-valves to a ritual that turns lies to brine. If the Judge rises and hears silence, nothing good will follow back downstream.",
    "objectives": [
        "Travel upriver to the seventh terrace and meet Rae Fen at the bell shrine.",
        "Repair or replace the severed bell-strings before flood-swell.",
        "Present evidence of hidden bleed-valves gathered in M2 and M4 during the rite.",
        "Protect the bell-ringers from saboteurs during the ceremony.",
        "Assist Ys Hul in sanctifying a temporary rebalancing of sluice gates.",
        "Escort the procession’s testimony to be recorded at the Aethral Archive."
