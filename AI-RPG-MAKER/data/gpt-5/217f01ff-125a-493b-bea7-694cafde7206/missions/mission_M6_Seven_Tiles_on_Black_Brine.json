    "description": "Shattermere lies under a sky that cannot decide if it is glass or water. The augury tiles cut from its cracked plates tell futures that sailors trust and magistrates fear. A perfect unbroken pane has lifted from the brine, inscriptions shifting under its surface like eels in light. High Acolyte Shunn Rippleborne asks you to retrieve it before dusk and test the inscriptions, not with greed, but with gratitude. The pane may hold a map of the city's reflections and a warning about bells rung in the wrong silence.",

        "Meet Shunn Rippleborne at the Glassward Infirmary for a blessing against mirages.",
        "Travel to Shattermere and locate the unbroken pane before dusk.",
        "Use your Azure Lens Pendant to read the pane’s submerged inscriptions.",
        "Arrange seven omen-tiles correctly to unlock the pane’s prophecy safely.",
        "Record any mention of bells, the Blue Maw, or oath-lanterns.",
        "Return the pane to the Temple of the Tidemother for safekeeping."

You will carry the pane as you would carry a child's name, with care and with the knowledge that the sea loves to collect what is beautiful and careless."

Do not let Kelen see anything that looks like permission, Thalen. Bring me a rubbing of the inscriptions; I want to check our lenses against a future that doesn't explode."

Thalen, if you see a pattern that sings with our prototypes, bring it to me, and I will make this city's lamps sing one safe note."
