    "description": "The Whispering Aqueduct carries the city's thirst on a spine of pale stone, and the pipes mutter like sleepers who dream of floods. Ys Hul of the Choir of Silt meets you beneath an arch where noon light cannot find a shadow, because the keystone was bought with one. The Choir suspects hidden bleed-valves are siphoning flow to private cisterns, starving terraces for coin and leverage. Your own secret nights upstream itch like a rash under your collar. To rebalance what is owed without drowning the city in fury, you must hear the aqueduct's memory and pull truth from stone without letting it crack.",

        "Collect a sample of hush-ink residue if present on valve housings.",
        "Decide whether to disclose knowledge of an additional secret valve you discovered in the past.",
        "Report to Ys Hul and present your findings."

The aqueduct mutters of theft, Thalen Vire, not the kind that empties bowls, but the kind that empties trust. Walk and listen, but do not be tricked by the Ledgers price of silence; they sell quiet like salt, and both sting when rubbed into wounds."

If valves are hiding where shadowed charters say they are not, the silt will have held its breath there and the bell will tell me. I will mark them and bring you more than accusation; I will bring measurements, residue, and the exact sound of guilt."

Your throat carries a rumor of the Maw, and rumors are bad at differentiating. Submit your notes; let the Court sort ethics from hydraulics."

If it feeds a private cistern bought with a neighbors hunger, the water remembers the taste of debt. I will listen and name them cleanly."
