    "description": "Moonhook Docks crackle with blue lamps and union drums even before dawn, and the smell of brine argues with the smell of fear. The brittle pact between dockworkers and harbor guards is splintering over seized cargo and unpaid night tariffs. Kema Hookhand calls her favor: stand between the Tidewardens horn crews and the Blue Fists hardliners and make a silence big enough for two sides to hear a third way. You carry the Temple's Conch of Slack Water and a reputation for stilling a storm without killing the sea. This time, your silence must not stop a heart.",

        "Meet Kema Hookhand at Pier Three before dawn.",

        "Prevent hardliners from lighting a brass-lamp riot signal during talks.",

They seize our cargo, they dock our pay, and they hum horn-drills at sleepers to remind them who holds the tide. You owe me one quiet that isn't a choke, Thalen. Stand in the breath between a wage and a war."

My crews are tired, our pay is thin, and command wants seizures to show control. If your conch can make a circle where words don't ricochet off rage, I'll bring my best knots. But one brass flare in the caverns and the Commodore will bring the horn-barge."

Let us trade a rhythm: Blue Fist safety captains on every pier, Tidewardens on-call during dead calm, and a schedule of seizures that ring with cause, not whim."

But if the Ledger dips their masks into this and steals the slack, we break chains in public. I won't watch my people starve politely."
