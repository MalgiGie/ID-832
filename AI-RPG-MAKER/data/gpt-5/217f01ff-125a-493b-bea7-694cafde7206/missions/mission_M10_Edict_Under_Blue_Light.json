    "description": "The Lantern Court convenes in the Sapphire Diadem, walls soft with blue glow and voices hard with old grudges. Delegates argue the focusing ring, the relocation of oath-lanterns, and the rebalancing of the aqueduct. Kelen Prism speaks of unifying light into one benevolent beam, Dorn Rigger warns of resonance disasters, Orven Caldris offers a 'contingency' to sell off lanterns if panic cracks the Diadem. You arrive carrying a chain shard, a pane rubbing, a bribes ledger copy, and the smell of river bells still in your hair. The city will either braid its power anew or saw through the rope to make two shorter ropes that fray when pulled.",
    "objectives": [
        "Present findings from M1–M9 to the Lantern Court in formal session.",
        "Argue against the sale of oath-lanterns and for temporary upstream rebalancing.",
        "Propose a joint Choir–Artificer test to still the Blue Maw briefly without a full focusing ring.",
        "Counter Orven Caldris’s motion with evidence from the bribes ledger.",
        "Secure an authority writ to conduct the Maw ritual with Tidewarden support.",
        "Negotiate a ceasefire between Kelen Prism and Dorn Rigger to share designs safely."

Authorize a narrow Choir–Artificer rite with horn support, not a ring that makes us sing one note forever. And keep the oath-lanterns where oaths can find them."
