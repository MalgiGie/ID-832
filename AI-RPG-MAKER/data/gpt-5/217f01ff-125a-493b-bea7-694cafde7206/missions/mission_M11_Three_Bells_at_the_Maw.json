    "description": "The Blue Maw rolls like a sleeping lung, swallowing light and giving it back as ribbons to roofs that fear and adore it. Under a sky held breathless by rumor, skiffs ring the rim and the horn-barge drifts like a patient animal. You stand at the bow with Ys Hul, Miren Nine-Ropes at your shoulder, the Vent-Wind Flute around your neck, the silt-bell at your palm, and the Elder Chain shard cold in your pocket. The plan is as thin as a reed: still the Maw just long enough to hear what it remembers, tune the Diadem's hum away from the breaking pitch, and prove to a city that river and sea can reconcile without a ring that commands them both. The sea remembers your promise: bring the city to stillness when the bells demand.",
    "objectives": [
        "Sail to the rim of the Blue Maw with Tidewarden escort.",
        "Position skiffs according to Arla Third-Tone’s bell pattern.",
        "Blow the Vent-Wind Flute to draw a controlled draft across the Maw.",
        "Ring the Third-Tone Silt-Bell underwater to carry Choir speech through the current.",
        "Use the Elder Chain Shard to cancel any ancient command that surfaces.",
        "Survive the oppressive silence and release the draft before three bells can ring in absolute silence."

The Maw remembers a heart that may have been a city once, or a promise, or a punishment. We will listen together and learn which it is. Hold the bell steady; let the river speak into the sea without begging."

When I call the pattern, trust it, even if your bones want you to stop your ears. The first calm is a liar; the second is a friend; the third is a grave."
