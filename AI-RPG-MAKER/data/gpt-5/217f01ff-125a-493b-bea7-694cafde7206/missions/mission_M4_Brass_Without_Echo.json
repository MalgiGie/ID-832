    "description": "The Night Bazaar of Brass wakes when honest lamps sleep, its alleys stitched together by shadows that know the taste of coin. Mist-Matron Sall Brass offers to trade information for calm: a ledger of blindfold rulings and smuggling routes, and, more importantly, the location of a retired Tidewarden's private bribe book that could topple half the Lantern Court if it ever breathed. To expose the aqueduct bleed-valves without burning the city, you need leverage. But the Bazaar trades in names as currency, and the wrong purchase can erase your own.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Sall Brass in the hidden court behind a curtain of ringing bowls.",
        "Locate the retiree Tidewarden's cavern locker beneath Pier Two.",
        "Bypass Syndicate arbitration without breaking the Bazaar's rules.",
        "Secure the bribe ledger and copy key entries using hush-ink.",
        "Decide whether to deliver the original to the Temple, the Court, or the Syndicate.",
        "Leave the Bazaar without triggering the dim-lamp alarm pattern."

The bribes ledger you sniff after has made stronger people than you forget how to speak their name. Take it cleanly and you will have a knife sharp enough to slice contracts you have never seen. But cut too deep and you'll bleed the city's trust onto the stones."

There are belts of duty and belts of shame, and sometimes they look the same in brass light. Do what you came to do, but don't humiliate us into rashness."

Bring me a copy so I know who owes who breath, and you can keep the original for whatever temple you trust. Remember: brass lamps dim for boots and brighten for courage."
