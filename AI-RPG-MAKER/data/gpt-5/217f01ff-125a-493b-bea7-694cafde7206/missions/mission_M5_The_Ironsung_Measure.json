    "description": "Two days up the mule line, the Ironsung Pass breathes its flute-song, and miners time their picks to its old empire rhythm. Now a new shaft sings a note that no throat can match without something in it breaking, and some who tried now speak only in whispers. Sera Flintline's veil smells of stone dust and stubbornness as she asks you and Arla Third-Tone to descend, find the measure, and silence what should not sing. The Diadem's hum and the Pass's discord may be the same melody played in cruel keys.",

It throws a note that makes men afraid to speak and women lose their balance, and I cannot afford to lose one more voice to a stone's whim. Bring me silence that respects work, not the kind that smothers it."

            "line": "Resonance is a law like any other, and this shaft is breaking it by amplitude, not by pitch. I can count us down between waves so we step into the quiet troughs, but if the mountain keeps an old war-song, we will need to learn its refrain. The bell-codes will sound like lullabies compared to what lies below."

If both notes feed each other, the city is being strummed by something that does not care where our edges are. We'll retune the shaft with a wedge instead of a blast and bring the mountain's breath back to labor time."

Do it without collapsing my lease, and I will speak a good word in chambers where dust is treated like blood. But if you break the rhythm that keeps us safe, I will brick you up with the rest of the mistakes this city made."
