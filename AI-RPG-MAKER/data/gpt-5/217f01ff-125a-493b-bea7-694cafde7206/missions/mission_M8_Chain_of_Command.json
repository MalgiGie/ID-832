    "description": "Half a day along the coast, the Elder Chain Shoals gnash at hulls and pride. A sloop ran aground, her captain lashed to the mast with eyes fixed as if obeying a command only iron remembered. Tidewardens recovered a ring branded with forbidden sigils that hum when brought near the Diadem. Commodore Jath Pell presses your hand with old gratitude and new worry: learn the ring's voice, sever any old empire command riding in its rust, and keep the horn-barge from becoming a tyrant by accident.",

        "Meet Commodore Jath Pell at the Tidewarden tower above Moonhook.",
        "Sail with a skiff crew to the Elder Chain Shoals during low tide.",
        "Use the Resonant Stone Tuning Fork to read the ring’s command motif.",
        "Disrupt the motif with your Vent-Wind Flute and the Third-Tone Silt-Bell.",
        "Recover a shard safely and return the rest to the sea to quiet the command.",
        "Deliver the shard to Miren Nine-Ropes for secure storage."

If the Diadem's lenses pick up this voice, we'll end up shouting orders at our own reflections until the city marches itself into the Maw."

The flute will draw breath through the gap, and the sea will take back what isn't ours to hold. We'll keep a shard to remind ourselves how close we came to letting iron tell us who to be."
