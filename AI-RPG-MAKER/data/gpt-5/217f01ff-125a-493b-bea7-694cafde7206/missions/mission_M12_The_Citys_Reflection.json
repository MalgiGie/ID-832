    "description": "The Maw's breath returns in a measured exhale, and Veylcrest's chimes ring not with panic, but with relief that makes hands shake. Under the Sapphire Diadem, a secret Artificer prototype—the skeleton of a focusing ring—gleams like a crown of bad decisions. The broken lens gallery hum has shifted, less a scream, more a warning. Dorn Rigger asks you for one last walk: into the Diadem's underworks to tune the city to itself, not to a single voice. Kelen Prism arrives with apology and stubborn wonder. Orven Caldris arrives with an offer to buy forgiveness in bulk. Nhal Vessin watches with a shipwright’s eye for cracks. Your hands are steady. Your throat hums at the edge of silence. The city is listening.",

Rigger, Prism—make your peace and make me a standard. Thalen, finish what you started when you first heard the Diadem hum."

We set the array to watch without striking, we keep our lamps where oaths can find their way home, and we put our bribes on the table where the blue light can burn off the mold. Let the hum be a lullaby, not an alarm."
