Pyre-Mistress Kael Ibrin pressed a soot-scented mask into Neris Quay’s hands, its filters whispering as if they already knew the taste of guilt, and set out the charge with the severity of an oath: escort a basalt caravan across pumice fields in an ash-squall, keep lungs working when masks grew few, parley with drake-tamers at the warm vents without lighting a war, and pry loose an obsidian core to tune Parliament’s truth-lamps and edge the Basilica’s ritual blades. The Wardens swore the ash remembered shapes, and this veil remembered Neris, or at least the shape of a choice once made to turn a flame backward so a law could stumble and a city could breathe longer; the wind changed and glass-ice formed on any skin that dared the air, whispering with every sting, you knew and you did it anyway. The caravan’s ropes creaked like conscience, the basalt blocks thrummed with a miner’s hymn, and the pumice fields sparkled like a field of teeth waiting for a word to bite. Drakes wheeled along the rim where warm vents breathed, their silhouettes like winged commas in an interrupted sentence, watching to see whether this crossing would be a story of bargains, or a story of blood.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort a basalt caravan across pumice fields during an ash-squall while rationing masks to keep everyone breathing.\",\n        \"Negotiate with drake-tamers for safe crossing near a guarded warm vent without provoking a fight.\",\n        \"Retrieve an obsidian core suitable for ritual blades and lamp tuning from a vent-ring.\",\n        \"Protect the caravan from ash drakes hunting from the high rim.\",\n        \"Deliver basalt and obsidian to Chainreach and Brightreach respectively.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kael Ibrin\", \"lines\": \"Ash lies and tells the truth in the same breath, and both will cut you if you lean too close; it shows you the faces you miss and the debts you prefer to miscount, and it will keep showing them until you tally properly. Keep your veil tight and your heart steady, because panic drinks air faster than any sprint and leaves a throat as raw as a scraped knee. If masks run thin, you will have to pick which breath to save, and I will not insult you by pretending that choice can be made cleanly or without cost. Remember this: miners without wind bring down cities just as surely as broken vows, because a hinge cannot rise if the hands that raise it are coughing blood on the gantries. Return with rock and calm, and I will write you a route through our stockpiles without tariff, and I will call your name at our ember-lamp when ash days come again. If the ash speaks to you, answer it with work, because the ash respects only what endures.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Drake-Tamer Havo\", \"lines\": \"We raise what your Wardens fear and fear what your Wardens raise, and between those two fears a vent steams hot enough to boil pride if you set it too near. The warm throat you seek burns under our watch, ours by inheritance from the veils themselves, and the veils remember who fed them salt and who fed them names. We will share warmth if you do not steal names for your Parliament lamps, because names traded to glass are meals that never end and we tire of being eaten by reflections. Bring us sacks of salt and a promise not to hunt our broods with vanity blades, and you may pass as if you were smoke at dusk, seen and then forgotten. Bring us a trick and we will teach the ash your scent until even your shadow coughs, and even your birds forget your call. Speak plainly, archer, because drakes hear the tremor under words and answer tremor with talon.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Quay\", \"lines\": \"The only thing I bring the ash is patience, and patience never burned a vent nor broke a treaty rope, though it has singed more than a few tempers. We need warmth to shape stones that keep a river honest, and a river that keeps its promises pays everyone along its banks, including those who sell salt and those who hatch wings. We will trade salt and silence for passage, and we will leave no net over your roosts, no mark on your eggs, and no boast on our tongues when the wind swings. We will be gone like a good story after its last line, leaving behind nothing but a changed listener and a little more room to breathe. If the ash asks me a question, I will answer with my feet moving and my mask tied, because sometimes that is the only answer that keeps the ledger straight. If you need a witness to our promise, I have cord and I know the etiquette of knots.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Gantrix Pell\", \"lines\": \"Basalt that does not ring right under a hammer makes hinges that sing at the wrong time, and a wrong-time song in a hinge is a city’s throat closing when it should be singing. Choose your cores with a listener’s ear and a signal crew’s suspicion, because rock can dream of falling the way men dream of cheating, and both dreams end badly for those below. Bring me rock that likes responsibility, not rock that flirts with edges, so that when storm-songs roll down the river our teeth drop true, not slantwise. Remember that a hinge will memorize the music of its making and hum it back under pressure, so teach it something steady, not something clever. If you cannot find the perfect tone, find the honest one; honest things rarely betray you except in public and then at least everyone learns.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sav Orlai\", \"lines\": \"When you hold the obsidian, do not look at your reflection too long, because it is not exactly your reflection and it is bored with resembling you. It asks questions with answers shaped like edges, and it will offer to shave off the parts of you that hesitate until all that is left is a blade that wonders why it still bleeds. If it seems to wink, close your eyes and count to eight, because eight is the number for letting go and for stepping back from thresholds that gulp. Wrap it in cloth that has seen moonlight, not sunlight, because sunlight makes it vain and vain glass cuts careless. If you begin to hear your own footsteps behind you, that is the pane under the Conservatory saying hello; do not say hello back unless you wish to be overheard by a city of windows.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"M09-C1\", \"title\": \"Ration by the Work of the Hands\", \"text\": \"You halt the caravan before the pumice flats and make a lantern-lit circle, and you speak slowly so even the newest miner can count their breaths with you. Masks go to the cutters, the haulers, and the two rook-handlers whose birds can carry a cry beyond the squall; those at the tail will rotate in when the ash veils thicken at the dunes. You keep one spare filter pinned at your own throat, a promise to break if a cough goes wet in the lungs of someone whose hands are on the basalt and not on the politics. You ask the Wardens to accept that duty comes before rank, and you trade one of your spare arrows for a cracked mask someone has patched with wax, because symbols are as necessary as air when the world goes grey. You hand out cord-knots to count minutes of breathing, and you tell them that knots do not lie even when flames do, and you knot the first one yourself and hold it up until every eye settles.\", \"outcome\": \"The work-crews move like a single creature across the pumice, and though the ash coughs into their sleeves, the rhythm of knots and rotations keeps fear from stealing more breath than the squall. A Warden grumbles but nods when he sees a younger miner step aside at the signal-cord and rejoin later with a fresh filter, and a quiet solidarity grows heavier than the ash. Two masks fail near the rim, and you snap your spare free and take a raw breath that razors your throat so a cutter can finish a lift, and later the Wardens mark your name in their ember book. The caravan loses no one to suffocation, though three need hot water and ash-tea at dusk, and the basalt remains unblooded by panic. Your reputation for fairness among the Ashen Wardens rises, and word reaches Chainreach that you count duty with a straight rope, smoothing the later delivery and the tariff-free route Kael promised.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M09-C2\", \"title\": \"Bargain at the Vent with a Salt Oath\", \"text\": \"You approach the drake-tamers with your hands open and your bow unstrung, and you bow not as a supplicant but as one riverborn to another who keeps a dangerous current. You lay out the salt sacks, not as a payoff but as a share of warmth paid in a currency the veils understand, and you speak the nature of the work and the limit of the promise so that the ash cannot find space to misunderstand it. You offer a corded oath in the style of the Basilica but without their sanction, tying it tide-order, low, slack, high, slack, so the veils hear courtesy in the pattern if not sacred authority. You promise silence about their broods and no hunting of drakes with blades meant for vanity and parade, and you add a line that respects inheritance by naming the vent in the tamer’s tongue as theirs for the next nine moon-turns. You ask for passage and a single hour of shared heat to temper an obsidian core, and you look up only at the end to meet their eyes and let them test your steadiness like a rope under load.\", \"outcome\": \"Havo tastes a pinch of your salt, nods once, and ties your offered cord into a shape that no Basilica priest would recognize but that the vent accepts with a hiss as the ash parts around your circle. The drakes settle on the rim and watch with a hunger that is not for flesh but for the story of you failing, and you deny them that story by keeping your people quiet and your hour exact, and by quenching your pride when a handler corrects your stance near the vent’s lip. In return, a tamer shows you which black stone sings cleanly when dipped, and you mark the core without scarring the throat, earning a nod from a Warden who had been measuring you for arrogance. Word travels that you tied a real bargain without stealing a name, and the drake-tamers’ hostility softens into a wary tolerance that will keep your scent off their hunt for a season. The caravan passes unhindered, and the route is now a thread in the veils that will not tangle so easily the next time a Warden’s lantern glows on the rim.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M09-C3\", \"title\": \"Choose the Honest Stone Over the Beautiful One\", \"text\": \"At the vent-ring you find three cores: one glossy as a liar’s eye, one matte-black with a faint hum like a low note from the Hinges, and one spidered with delicate flaws that catch the moon’s idea of starlight. You let your hand drift over each without touching, and you listen the way Gantrix Pell taught you to listen, for the difference between a rock that plans to fall and a rock that plans to hold. The beautiful core shows you a face in its depths, your own and not your own, and for a moment the pane under the Conservatory seems to breathe warm against your cheek, promising ease and leverage if you just take the pretty edge. You step back and count to eight the way Sav Orlai said, and when your breath steadies, you choose the humming core and wrap it in cloth that has seen moonlight, not sunlight, because vanity is the first chip taken by time. You mark the vent’s stone with a chalk rune for thanks, not command, and the steam rises as if in approval instead of anger.\", \"outcome\": \"The humming core warms your palms without burning, and when you lift it, the drakes on the rim go still for a heartbeat the way birds still themselves when truth passes overhead. When you test the tone with a knuckle, it answers with a note that holds steady even as the ash eddies try to shake it, and a Warden grins with their eyes, which is as close as Wardens get to open praise on a squall day. The glossy core cracks itself as the wind turns, and a snarl under the ash tells you what kind of story you just refused, one that would have cut easy and then cut everything. The spidered stone sheds a flake that winks before it dies, and you feel a tug from the distant living pane go slack, which is a relief you do not admit aloud. Later, at Brightreach, the Conservatory’s grinder whistles the low note back and says, this one will tell the truth about light without wanting to be seen first, and that is exactly what we asked for.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M09-C4\", \"title\": \"Fight the Drakes with Lantern-Decoys and Line-Arrows\", \"text\": \"When the shadow-sweep warns you of a dive, you raise no shout; instead you order the lantern-bearers to set three decoys wide on the pumice plain, then snuff your real forward lights and trust your memory of the field. You load knot-hook arrows and fix haul-lines not to the stones but to the basalt sleds, so a tug becomes traction and a fall becomes a slow drag instead of a plunge. You send a mirror-flash up to draw the first drake’s eye and loose high, not to wound but to snag, and the line sings as the beast tries to carry the decoy lantern into the ash until it stumbles into its own confusion. You keep the caravan low, masks tight, and you speak to panic as if it were a mule that knows you—slow words, short orders, and a palm on the nearest shoulder so fear has to move through touch before it reaches the mind. When a drake finally commits and drops for blood, you meet it with a second hook that knots its wing to a sled, and the weight pulls it skidding in a shower of black glass until it breaks free and flees, stung and wiser.\", \"outcome\": \"The decoys burn bright enough to hold the drakes’ hunger at the edge of the field, and only one serious pass makes it to the caravan, blunted by your angle and the good sense of miners who lie flat when told. A Warden’s cloak tears and one handler takes a talon-scratch that blossoms like a red flower on grey cloth, but your field-stitches are sure and the ash cooperates by caking the wound shut long enough to reach cover. The drakes circle twice more, then decide the meal costs more than it feeds, and they lift to the rim to watch you with the cold respect of predators who have learned a boundary. Havo’s people take note that you bled their cousins as little as you could while still keeping your people alive, and their nod is not warm but it is real, which is what matters in a place that eats pretense. The caravan arrives with every sled intact, and the story that spreads says you fight like a river: you pull, you redirect, and if someone tries to stand against you, they find themselves elsewhere without quite knowing how they moved.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M08\"], \"next\": [\"M10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Ash-Veil mask with improved soot-filters, its veils tuned by Wardens to drink ash without drinking breath.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Hardened basalt climbing claws for safer hinge and cliff traversal, tempered at a vent so they bite wet stone like a promise.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Reputation: Ashen Wardens (escorted caravan favor), recorded by Pyre-Mistress Kael Ibrin as a debt of ash-days and safe lanes.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"knowledge\", \"description\": \"Knowledge: the chosen obsidian core resonates with the living pane under the Mirrorglass Conservatory, and it hums truer when wrapped in moon-touched cloth and not shown its own reflection.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
