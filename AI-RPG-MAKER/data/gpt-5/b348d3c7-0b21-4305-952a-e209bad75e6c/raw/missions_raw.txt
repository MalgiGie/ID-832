The streets beyond were already honeyed with brass lanterns, and the market bridges creaked under the weight of onlookers and rumor. The Archivists feared a seizure or a scandal before the consecrated re-knotting, for Parliament had been sniffing at sealed writs and the Rookery’s mirror-kites were keeping vigil without declaring their employer.
