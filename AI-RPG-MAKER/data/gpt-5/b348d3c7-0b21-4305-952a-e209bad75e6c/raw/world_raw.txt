"{\n  \"city\": \"Avarinth, the Hinge of Rivers, straddles three low granite isles where the River Sel breaks into a silver delta. The city is cinched by monumental tide-gates called the Hinges, iron-boned structures whose counterweights rise like ribs above the canals. At dusk, a thousand brass lanterns paint the mist in honey-colored halos, and the air smells of brine, saffron, and hot pitch from the boatyards. Bridges creak with the weight of market stalls; rooflines bristle with message-poles and weather-vanes carved as fish, knives, and crescent moons.\\n\\nAvarinth is an engine of water and light. Its architects favor buoyant terraces and floodwise arcades, with stonework etched in wave glyphs and inlaid with slivers of mirrorglass. The city’s wealth flows through four crafts: tidewrighting (the precise art of taming currents), dye-lore (saffron, ochres, and moon-bitten pigments), optical alchemy (mirrorglass, lenses, and signal lanterns), and river trade (grain, basalt, amber, and ash). Inkroot, a marsh-grown tuber, is pulped into long-lived parchment, and Avarinth’s ledgers are famous for outliving the fortunes they record.\\n\\nGovernment is a contest of lamps. The Lantern Parliament sits in a hall whose ceiling is a forest of chains from which hang ward-lamps and guild-lamps. When a vote is called, each faction lights its lamp with a tinctured flame, so the color of Avarinth’s law can be read from the street. The Parliament’s writ is tempered by the great guilds, whose contracts bind as tightly as any edict. Judges read not only statute but the knots in sanctified cords at the Basilica of Knotted Light, where oaths are literally tied and kept.\\n\\nAvarinth was founded by refugees who fled the Shattered Weir of Sel three centuries ago, when the old river-dam broke like a jaw and drowned the upstream cities. The First Hinge was raised from scavenged stone and the rumored ribs of a river-drake that washed ashore; whether beast or machine, its bones still hum when storms roll in. The city survived the Night of the Unmoored, when a sabotage of the hinges loosed a black tide into the lower wards, and the Lantern Schism, when the Basilica’s Fifth Knot denounced the Parliament and was exiled to the Pilgrim’s Stair.\\n\\nToday Avarinth thrives but leans on its margins. Silt is choking the northern channels, ash-fogs descend more often from the Ash-Veil Caldera, and whispers say glasswraiths prowl the Mirrorglass Conservatory’s oldest vaults. The Tidewrights’ Syndicate claims sovereignty over all hinges and canals, but the River-Marrows Guild runs the docks and knows every backwater. Merchants of the Saffron and Ochre Compact quietly buy lantern-seats one flame at a time. The Rookery of Whisper-Brokers owns the air above the city as surely as any guild owns stone. Avarinth’s light is bright, but bright light casts knife-sharp shadows.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Glass Spine Ridge\",\n      \"distance_days\": 2,\n      \"direction\": \"northeast\",\n      \"description\": \"A serrated ridge of milk-quartz and obsidian shards thrusts from the earth like a broken comb, its facets catching dawn light until the whole spine glows.
