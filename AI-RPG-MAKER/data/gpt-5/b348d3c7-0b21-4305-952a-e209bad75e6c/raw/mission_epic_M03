Brass trays drifted through the galleries like medals unpinned from invisible uniforms, catching and schooling stray glows until arguments looked like weather maps. Saffron perfume clung to the steps, oil smoke to the rafters, and under it all lay the briny whisper of the River Sel, a reminder that the city’s pulse was water and that every lamp owed a debt to tides tamed by hands who might yet let go. Tonight the dye-lords arrived in cloaks that shifted hue with every breath, the Tidewrights stood with knuckles lantern-scarred and jaws tight, and ward delegates leaned together like boats roped stern to stern before a storm. Rumors slithered along the galleries that moon-resin fakes had been cooked to burn backward, a wicked lacquer that could tilt the count by tasting fear and reflecting it, that could hiss white when it should hum pearl, or deepen to a bruise where trust ought to glow. The Basilica’s oath-knots hung along the east wall as if they were patient judges waiting for a confession no one wanted to make, cords braided with moon-resin that hummed in tiny moth-drawing notes. Somewhere behind the west gallery, a mirrored passage exhaled the soft breath of eavesdroppers, and the Rookery’s ghost-laughter flitted like birds that refused cages. Neris Quay stood above the river-stone map inlaid across the floor and felt the old balance return: knees loose for a rooftop run, hands clean enough for a knot, eyes tuned for the instant when a lamp told the truth sideways. Talo Ren’s gratitude for a saved barge weighed visibly across his shoulders like a borrowed cloak that he feared to tear, and in the hall’s giant pupil of light, he asked not for an arrow but for a gaze. Politics smelled like hot pitch on a wet wind, and the quay it built in the mind was narrow: too slick to stand still, too crowded to run, and edged with water that remembered every name thrown into it.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Inspect the fuel and wicks of the vote-lamps for moon-resin adulteration before the floor bell rings.\",\n        \"Shadow the mirrored listening passage and note any Rookery brokers coordinating the timing of interruptions.\",\n        \"Decide how to handle a discovered forged moon-flame: expose it publicly to Ista Brine, or swap it silently to prevent a scandal without implicating allies.\",\n        \"Protect Talo Ren during the vote from a staged stumble designed to spill saffron dye onto tally cords.\",\n        \"Deliver your findings to either the Speaker or the Archivists for record.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Talo Ren\",\n          \"lines\": \"You make a habit of plucking the city out of its own teeth, Neris, and I have not forgotten the line you cast when the river tried to turn Parliament into driftwood. I would like to believe we are steadied by principles, but I have seen how easily a colored flame can teach a lie to pass for order. Tonight I ask for your eye more than your string, because a good eye is a lamp that no hand can cup, and the count must be lit by truth or it burns us all. If a flame lies in this hall, I must know before I raise the tray and kindle the tally, or I become another man who says flood to hide theft, another Speaker who mistakes spectacle for safety. Help me keep this vote upright, even if it tilts the world against me tomorrow, because I would rather be hated in daylight than praised by a darkness I helped pour.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Clerk-Marshal Ista Brine\",\n          \"lines\": \"If you find a counterfeit flame, you bring it to my desk with the wick still warm, and we will write a charge that even the Basilica cannot untie because the knots will be tied to proof and not to tremor. Do not play priest with fire in this hall, archer, for the gods we serve are records, seals, and the calm of a cord that bears weight. The law tolerates a quiet swap only when the alternative is blood, and even then the law remembers who bled and who kept the cloth clean by stepping back. If you choose theater over order, be ready to bow with the actors and learn how to greet a jeer as if it were incense. Bring me the fraud, I will give you the paper that names it, and together we will see if the lamp that burns backward can serve justice by being correctly extinguished.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Factor Lisi Jhak\",\n          \"lines\": \"Our lamps burn pure because our patrons demand it, and because impure light turns profits sour and dissolves the discipline on which markets survive. I have no patience with insinuations dressed as safety, and less with clerks who mistake dyecraft for sacrament and imagine commerce kneels when they raise a quill. Walk carefully and do not slander what keeps your ward-lamps lit, because the city’s nights are made of our work as surely as its days are made by tides. The market punishes lies as surely as any god, and the Compact remembers who casts shade at noon and who has the decency to bargain in the cool of evening. If there is a fake among the flames, it did not come from my vats; and if you intend to prove otherwise, come with proof that does not smell of envy.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Broker Thay Nerr\",\n          \"lines\": \"The wrong color at the right second can decide whether docks eat or starve, and I say this as a man who sells seconds by the ounce and has never found a cheaper currency. I do not tell you this as a man with a stake in the outcome, though I admit that I have a stake in every outcome and that neutrality is a mask I rent by the bell. You have been a very precise storm when I needed one, Neris, a gust that arrives as if it were an accident rehearsed by fate. Remember that sometimes rescuing a law from itself requires a hand no one sees and a silence that can be sworn only to oneself. Decide whether you want gratitude or righteousness, and accept the price, because you cannot eat both and I have brokers who will eat either if you leave them unattended.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Neris Quay\",\n          \"lines\": \"Flames remember the fingers that set them alight, and if I listen closely, I can hear the echo in the hiss where resin meets wick. I will watch the lamps, and if one burns backward, I will make sure it does not take the city with it, even if I must burn my own sleeve to smother it. The river does not love liars, even when they float, and I have seen what a lie looks like when it finally sinks and drags a barge of names down with it. If I must choose between a truth that shames and a silence that stains, I will choose the truth and learn to wash. And if a hand reaches to spill saffron across the tally cords, my arrow will pin that hand to the law long enough for the count to stand upright.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"C1\",\n          \"title\": \"Expose the counterfeit publicly to Clerk-Marshal Ista Brine\",\n          \"text\": \"You step from the gallery as the bell begins its iron prayer and walk across the river-stone map, each footfall a pebble dropped into circles of attention. The heat of the lamp tray prickles your knuckles as you lift the forged moon-flame with tongs, and you keep your breath shallow so the resin cannot hear your heartbeat. Voices sharpen into spear points as you set the lamp on Ista Brine’s desk and speak plainly about backward-burning resin and the hands that carried it. You do not name suspects without proof, but you paint the path of the lamp with words that glint like pins in a map, marking the mirrored passage, the Rookery glances, and the dye-slickened gloves. When you finish, you do not bow; you step back and let the hall see that truth does not kneel, even when it stands alone.\",\n          \"outcome\": \"Ista Brine raises her quill like a blade and writes the charge as if carving a channel through silt, each stroke a little river the flood must obey. The hall tightens first in scandal, then in the relief of a crisis named, and the Basilica’s knots hum as if pleased by the neatness of a revealed deceit. The forged lamp is quenched under a dome of clear glass, a hiss like a snake caught in a jar, and tally cords are re-strung, their strands checked by three witnesses and a prayer to patience. Talo Ren meets your eye and nods once, the nod of a man who asked for sight and received it, and his gratitude feels heavier now because it carries the weight of consequences. The Compact bristles, the Rookery goes still as roosting birds before a storm, and though rumors will follow you down the canals like wake, a narrow thread of cautious trust winds from the Parliament moderates to your name.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"C2\",\n          \"title\": \"Swap the forged moon-flame in silence\",\n          \"text\": \"You let the argument climb toward its bright cliff-edge while you move through shadows that treat you as an old friend. The forged lamp is a hot coin in your palm even through cloth, its color only slightly wrong, like a smile held a heartbeat too long. At the service passage, you draw a clean wick from a sealed pouch, feed it into a fresh lamp charged with honest resin, and swap the glass chimneys with a sleight you learned on rooftops when rain demanded grace. No one sees you but a rook on the iron lintel and the mirror that only pretends to be asleep, and you send each away with a tiny flash-code apology. When you return the tray, the count proceeds, the hues ring true, and the danger slides past the city like a knife that chooses not to cut.\",\n          \"outcome\": \"No scandal blooms, and for one night the Hall remains a temple to process rather than a theater of accusations, which is to say the city breathes easier and the docks do not light their anger. Talo Ren suspects something and chooses not to ask, rewarding outcomes over explanations with a grateful silence that loosens later into a private thanks. Ista Brine watches the edges of things and records nothing she cannot prove, sealing her unease into a neat packet to be opened someday with a sharper quill. The Rookery notices the second of sudden stillness and values it, and Thay Nerr will send a quiet cup of good tea to a certain roof with a view, which is his way of saying that a debt now balances on the wire. Your ledger remains lighter of scandal but heavier with secrets, and you carry the knowledge of the Compact’s resin volume like a coal wrapped in linen—useful heat, dangerous when ignored, and proof that what you saved tonight may yet burn elsewhere.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"C3\",\n          \"title\": \"Deliver findings to the Speaker of Lamps for immediate action\",\n          \"text\": \"When the lamps are cooled and the gallery thins to whispers, you climb the last stairs to the Speaker’s rostrum with your notes rolled like an arrow-shaft. You describe the adulterated wicks, the mirrored passage’s soft breath, and the timing of interruptions braided to rook-flashes that no one else heard because they did not learn the tongue of sky. You keep your words spare, because a man who tends lamps needs clean fuel not perfumed smoke, and you place your observations where his hands will find them without fumbling in the dark. You speak also of the planned stumble near the saffron tray and how a shoulder that never learned contrition will soon learn how a floor can teach humility. When you finish, you do not wait for thanks; you ask for guards on the tally cords and lanterns tuned by the Conservatory that ring a bell if light tilts against truth.\",\n          \"outcome\": \"Talo Ren reads twice, once with eyes and once with the part of his face that has learned to listen to light, and then he moves crews like a tidewright moving gates with call and counterweight. The stumble never happens because a sergeant chooses a new place to stand, and saffron never kisses the cords; instead it stains only a saboteur’s cuff, which proves remarkably helpful later. New lamp-handling protocols are adopted on the spot, and clerks whisper that the Speaker changed the color of law tonight without changing its letters. The Hall does not erupt, it settles, and the vote proceeds with a care that tastes like hard bread—plain, sustaining, and exactly what hunger needed. In the days that follow, a limited pass to gallery benches is pressed into your palm with quiet sincerity, and the moderates’ cautious trust takes root like a reed where current meets shore.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"C4\",\n          \"title\": \"Deliver findings to the Inkroot Archivists for sealed record\",\n          \"text\": \"You leave by a side door that still smells faintly of saffron wax and follow the canal to Reedbank where the millwheels breathe their even song. In the cool vault of the Inkroot Archives, you unseal your amber tube and spread the notes across a table that catches truth the way a net catches silver fish. Archivist-Mother Jana Fell listens the way paper dries, steady and without hurry, and asks questions that do not accuse but insist, knotting your answers with cords the Basilica would envy. You speak of resin volumes, of contracts that pour like dyes through hidden channels, and of a mirrored passage that sells reflections at rumor price. When you are done, you tie a seal-string that frays if the record is altered, and the air itself seems to exhale, as if relieved that an account now exists that water cannot soak and fire will hesitate to touch.\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The Archives accept your deposition into a sealed vault where mold is not allowed to sing, and a counter-string is knotted to tug should Parliament attempt to seize or edit the writ. Jana Fell does not promise protection, she promises memory, which outlasts protection and is harder to bribe, and she offers to countersign any lamp-protocol the Speaker proposes if it meets the measure of law. Word drifts—because word always drifts—that a certain archer delivers truth to ledgers before to lamps, and among the moderates this becomes a reason to trust rather than to shun. The Compact feels the pressure of a record that does not shout but refuses to forget, and some vats run a degree cooler for a fortnight while lawyers learn new prayers. In the balance, your reputation with those who prize procedure deepens, and your knowledge of the Orchard’s resin trade becomes a compass you can read when fog threatens to turn the city in circles.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M02\"], \"next\": [\"M04\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Parliament gallery pass for vote nights (limited), allowing attendance on specified sessions without escort.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Favor\", \"description\": \"Quiet favor from the Speaker of Lamps redeemable for safe passage during curfew or to clear a checkpoint without delay.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Knowledge\", \"description\": \"Confirmation that the Saffron and Ochre Compact has acquired moon-resin from the Moonfallen Orchard at unusual volumes indicative of manipulation risk.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Lantern Parliament moderates extend cautious trust toward Neris Quay for safeguarding the integrity of the vote.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
