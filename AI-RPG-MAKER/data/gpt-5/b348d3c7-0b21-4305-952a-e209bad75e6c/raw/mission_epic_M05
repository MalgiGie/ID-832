The reeds whispered in threads of old language, and where their syllables touched the glistening bulbs of fossilized resin, a music like breath trapped in glass tried to match your heartbeat. Saffron cloaks of Compact factors flickered along the higher banks like tame flames, their ledgers wrapped against the mist while their guards pushed poles into sullen mud that tried to bite back. Novices of the Order moved in Neris Quay’s shadow, their cord-looms slung like small harps, humming counter-melodies taught to resist the Fen’s nostalgia that crept up the spine like a warm hand. In the shallows, a shrine lay half-swallowed, its reed-flute visible between lilies like a bone waiting to be claimed, and shadows of fen-wraiths turned their faces wherever the sound of backward song leaked. The procession’s carts were banded in waxed rope and inkroot canvas, each wheel a small oath against the dragging bog, and each lamp tinted pearl-white to keep the work true. Avarinth’s debts and vows rode with those carts: consecration amber for the Basilica’s knots, verses to be warmed and heard and written before they sank again into the forgetful sweetness, and the reed-flute that might hush the wraiths from the trade channel before commerce learned to sing fear.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Archivist carts and novice cord-weavers along a reed-choked channel at fog-tide.\",\n        \"Locate and retrieve the reed-flute from a shrine half-sunk and guarded by fen-wraiths who bargain only in backward song.\",\n        \"Warm three amber bulbs to the skin to hear their captured verses and record any relevant names or places.\",\n        \"Negotiate safe passage with wraiths using backward-sung verses while keeping the carts from sinking in sudden pools.\",\n        \"Deliver consecration amber to the Basilica without contamination by dye residues.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jana Fell\", \"lines\": \"The Fen is a library that wants to keep its patrons, Neris, and it shelves not by alphabet but by ache. Every time we come, it tries to lacquer us in honeyed dreams until our names frost over and our pages never turn again. Keep the novices’ knots tight and their songs steady, because the counter-hum is a lifeline and I have seen it break when a memory smiles too sweetly. If you hear your own past sung back to you, bite your tongue until the iron taste is louder than the music and let the blood drown the sweetness that would drown you. We need the amber, not the dreams, and we need the flute, not the legend of its making. Watch for Saffron cloaks on the bank; they buy rights with weights and will call it law when their dyes touch our harvest. If a wraith bargains, remember that backward truth can be honest enough to save a life, but forward lies often curdle in this air.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Fen-Wraith\", \"lines\": \"Who warms our throats and steals our verses, reed-walker with a mirror in your eye and river in your bones? We have sung soldiers and saints and petty thieves, and you, arrow-weaver, smell of a forged flame that burned backward once and left a bruise in the lamps of men. Sing to us in the wrong order, and perhaps we will believe you, for the Fen remembers that truth can walk backward and still arrive. Bring us a lie you hate and we will trade you a truth you fear, for debts taste better when salted with regret. Step where the syllables are thick, or the pools will edit your stride from the sentence of your life. Your carts creak like oaths, your novices hum like hatchlings; give us a morsel of your name’s rope and we will uncoil the water ahead.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Quay\", \"lines\": \"I will sing you the sound of a rope slipping on wet rail, and the taste of dye on my tongue when I told myself it was only oil and not a market set ablaze by a backward flame. I bring carts that must pass and a flute that must hush your cousins from the trade, because even the city’s stomach cannot savor fear forever. Take the heat of my palm on this amber and give me safe water to walk, and I will leave you a braid of my breath to hum when the fog goes thin. I have walked roofs that slump like soft bread and gantries that argue with storms; I can walk your sentences without falling into their commas. We have no quarrel with your songs, only with the drowning they sell to the lonely and the overbrave, and I will pay with verses I do not care to hear again. If you ask for a lie, I will give you one I hate, and if you ask for a truth, I will swallow it neat if it buys my people one more step of dry ground.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rector Mera\", \"lines\": \"These bulbs will seal oaths that should never leak, and their breath will live in the Basilica’s cords longer than any one of us will live. Handle them like infants entrusted to a city that is not yet safe, for every lamp that burns within our ring burns against a wind that would rather extinguish than warm. If your hand shakes, steady it against your chest and breathe the Stair’s order: low, slack, high, slack, until your ribs remember how patience feels. We tie promises with more patience than hunger, because hunger hurries and makes knots that strangle, and patience makes knots that hold without harm. Keep the Saffron dyes far from our seal; their riches are not sanctity, and a single smear can turn a vow into an argument that unravels at first light. When you return, lay the amber on the oath-stone and let the moths come; if the moon-resin hums, you have kept the harvest clean.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lisi Jhak\", \"lines\": \"Compact guards have been tripping over wraith humors on this bank all week, and their boots come back singing in the dye-house, which is charming until the accountants hear it. If any Archivist amber walks into our purchases, I will bring writs and weights that make your knotted cords look like ribbon queens at a ward fair, and my ledgers will turn your patience into penalties. Stay to your survey and out of our harvest, because market lanes are as sacred as any aisle of lamps if you know how to read profit as a prayer. The market has a better memory than any swamp, and it writes in numbers that cannot be warmed and talked into forgetting. Help me keep the channels from fouling and I might help you keep your novices from singing debts they do not understand, but do not mistake my generosity for charity. If you must sing backward, do it softly where my buyers cannot hear you teaching the Fen about price.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Offer Your Backward Truth to the Fen\", \"text\": \"You stand before the half-sunk shrine and let the fog wet your cheeks, then you thread your breath into a backward hymn that tastes like old rope and ash. You choose a lie you hate, the one you once told yourself about a harmless flame wrapped in moon-resin, and you unwind it syllable by syllable as if untying an artery. The novices tighten their grips on cord-looms and hum under your notes, their eyes fixed on your hands as if your fingers could pilot the carts across the sentence of water. You press a warmed bulb to your collarbone and feel it answer with a verse that thrums your ribs, and you whisper its names to your ledger tube before the nostalgia can con you into keeping them. You promise the wraiths no theft of their choir, only a bartered bar of safe passage and the flute that will keep commerce from tasting like mourning. As the reeds lean in, you thread a final backward refrain that admits you are not pure but that you are faithful to the duty of keeping breath moving in the living.\", \"outcome\": \"The water unknots, the lily pads arrange themselves like stepping words, and a path surfaces with a hush like a library turning the page for a favored reader. The fen-wraiths coil their voices around you and return the reed-flute with a ripple of approval, and one of them breathes a secret verse into your warmed bulb that speaks of gloam that bites bone and of ledgers coiled in Dyers’ Spiral. The novices’ humming steadies into confidence, and the carts roll with only two heart-stopping lurches that your knot-hook arrows catch and correct before they become tragedies. When you deliver the consecration amber at the Basilica, Rector Mera tests it and nods once with a gravity that feels like a benediction, and the moths come without frenzy, which means your harvest is clean. Yet the wraiths do not leave empty-handed: they rehearse your backward confession among themselves, and a rumor with your shape begins to walk the fog, one that a Whisper-Broker or a Rector might someday overhear. You leave with the flute, the bulbs, and a new stillness in the novices’ step, and with a private sting where truth skinned your pride on the reeds.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Weave Light and Knot to Distract the Dead\", \"text\": \"You slide the mirrorglass from its pouch and tilt it to catch a dim crescent of sky, then split that pallid light into flash-codes the Rookery would frown to see used as bait. With your free hand you lay decoy cords across a hummocked bank, tying simple blessing-knots around empty reed bundles so they whisper like living throats from a safe remove. You instruct the novices to keep their counter-hum steady but low, and you pace the gantry of fallen logs as if it were a Parliament gallery, aiming each flash and knot like a vote at the wraiths’ attention. The fen-wraiths veer toward the dancing glints and the murmuring decoys, voices wavering with curiosity that smells like peat-smoke, and a shallow opens long enough for two carts to flow through. Though the trick holds, the air thickens with the sulk of offended guardians, and the fog grows mottled as if bruised by mirrors. You reach the half-sunk shrine in this borrowed window, fingers working quickly to free the reed-flute and to cup an amber bulb to your skin before the diversion dissolves.\", \"outcome\": \"The wraiths discover the ruse and respond with a heavy, deliberate wave that rolls like a shoulder through the channel, nearly swallowing the tail cart until your knot-hook arrow bites and hauls it to the word you chose for safety. Their anger does not strike as teeth but as memory sharpened to a hook; the novices tremble and one sobs into her loom, yet the humming never fails, and Rector Mera later praises steadiness without praising your method. The flute is yours, and beneath it the shrine stone had been scratched with a traders’ cant turned backward, naming gloam that bites bone and pointing, with an arrow no river can smooth, to Dyers’ Spiral and its bourse. The consecration amber remains clean—your care with the dye-laden banks shows in the cool, even moths that come to test it—and the Basilica marks the harvest as untainted. But the Fen keeps an account: wraith songs pursue your silhouette along Lowwater nights for a week, and Compact eyes narrow as they recognize Rookery tricks flatteringly misapplied to ghosts. The River-Marrows gossip that you made the dead dance with signal codes, which is a compliment in some mouths and a bill in others, and the Archivists note your result in ink that will not forget.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Cut a Trade Accord Through the Fog\", \"text\": \"You hail Lisi Jhak from the reedline with your hands open and your bow low, and you speak in the grammar of lanes and bells that merchants trust more easily than hymns. You propose a temporary division of water: Archivist carts to the inner bends, Compact skiffs to the outer sweep, with a shared silence kept at the shrine while you lift the flute and warm the bulbs. In return, you accept a single Compact outrider to witness that no amber crosses the ledger’s invisible line, and you promise to tie a visible contract-knot at the Stair when the work is done. The novices shift uneasily at the notion of partnering under saffron glare, but you hold their gaze and remind them that clean oaths can travel beside hard bargains without drowning. To persuade the wraiths, you sing the market’s backbeat backward—price to cost to labor to river, river to labor to cost to price—and you plant a copper-wrapped reed in the mud as an offering of weight. The fog listens like a judge, and something in the water’s calculus agrees that lanes, once drawn, should be respected until the bells change.\", \"outcome\": \"The accord cuts a swift, tidy passage, and the carts move as if the Fen itself had been hired to pole them, while Compact skiffs mirror your distance with professional cold. The reed-flute comes away from the shrine clean as a pulled tooth, the warmed bulbs hum true against your skin, and the moths later confirm what care and discipline already predicted: no dye has kissed the amber you bear. Lisi pays for fairness with information rather than coin, showing you a ledger addendum where a dye-process called gloam that bites bone appears in Dyers’ Spiral, masked under a festival cloth contract, and her smile says she expects you to spend that rumor where it will redden rivals. The Basilica’s blessing arrives with a layer of frost: Rector Mera approves the sanctity of the harvest but frowns at the precedent of cutting vows beside market lines, and Jana Fell’s ink smells of caution when she writes up the day. The Compact quietly claims in three countinghouses that it kept the Fen civil, and the Rookery purchases rooftop whispers about your diplomacy to resell them one bell later. The wraiths, for their part, keep their distance, and you knot the public contract at the Stair as promised, feeling the city’s lamps blink in alignment with a decision that will echo beyond the fog.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M04\"], \"next\": [\"M06\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Amber-beaded seal-string that preserves documents against water and heat, its resin hum faintly echoing the Fen’s patient songs.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"upgrade\", \"description\": \"Upgraded amber-sealed ledger tube with double gasket, proofed against dye-fog and hinge-spray for long canal runs.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"clue\", \"description\": \"A backward verse naming 'gloam that bites bone' linked to Dyers’ Spiral contracts, suggestive of hidden dye-process dealings at the Saffron Ledger Exchange.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Basilica of Knotted Light (supplier’s grace): quiet trust from Rector Mera’s circle for delivering consecration amber uncontaminated.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
