A River-Marrows pilot father taught current-sense; a mother who dyed sailcloth in Dyers’ Spiral taught color and patience. Neris apprenticed briefly to the Rookery as a sky-runner, where the bow became both tool and oath: line-arrows to throw rescue cords, bluntheads to crack signal lenses, bodkins to pin ropes without fray. On a red-sky evening during a sudden drawdown at Chainreach, Neris shot a knot-hook through the Speaker’s barge rail and hauled it true, earning the wary gratitude of Talo Ren. Archivist-Mother Jana Fell later contracted Neris to ferry sealed flood-writs and scout the Sunken Archive’s margins, where stone librarians watched with lantern-cold eyes and ink eels nosed at boot-leathers. Broker Thay Nerr of the Rookery refined Neris’s value, trading in quiet recoveries and louder rumors, and taught a lesson: in Avarinth, a signal is a blade if timed right. Neris now moves between wards and factions, a rooftop archer whose arrows stitch islands in emergencies and unpick knots when politics tangle. The city’s lamp-colors have begun to feel like weather to Neris, and weather can be read, ridden, and sometimes rewritten.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Sel-Reed Riverbow\",\n      \"description\": \"A laminated bow of river reed, ash veneer, and a basalt backing strip, strung with moon-resin-waxed cord that shrugs off damp.
