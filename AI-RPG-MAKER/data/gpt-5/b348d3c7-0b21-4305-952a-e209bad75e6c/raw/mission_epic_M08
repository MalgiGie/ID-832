Marble stacks leaned with algae shawls, their spine-etchings furred with moss and the fine grit of centuries, while stone librarians paced with cold lanterns cupped in hands that remembered flame without warmth. Bottled wind still hissed from a cracked reliquary somewhere in the western vault, a glass-thin whistle threading the water and tugging at boats as if the lake itself were lonely for voices, or for law. Jana Fell’s request came on parchment tough as fish-skin and sealed in honeyed amber: rescue hinge-craft treatises and flood-law precedent from the western stacks, copy lost diagrams the Tidewrights claimed by inheritance, and make sure the truth came up cleaner than the river’s own teeth. Orren Halv, Syndic of sluices and law by torque, sent a rasping addendum: diagrams of the western hinge-pivot or nothing, and if the constructs glowered, to answer with chord and precedent. Neris Quay stood on the weed-slick shore with ash-mask ready and bowcord waxed, Copper-thread luck glinting in tar-black braid, and the Mirrorglass signal mirror warm against the palm like a kept secret. The water pressed against the mask like an old grudge, and the city’s future pressed like a hand between the shoulder blades, urging a descent that felt too much like a vow. Lamps burned on the far banks in colors that meant commerce, caution, and compromise; their reflections shivered into threads that Neris imagined stitching into a safety net for this dive and all the dives to come. When the first kick took Neris under, the river-slick world steadied, and the drowned library opened its ribs to a visitor who had remembered to breathe.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Negotiate passage with a stone librarian by offering a correctly knotted visitor cord and a catalog of intended shelves.\",\n        \"Retrieve waterproof vellum etched with breathing runes and a labradorite tile that glows when truth is spoken.\",\n        \"Close the rift where bottled wind still hisses by weighting it with basalt and singing a hinge-song phrase.\",\n        \"Copy hinge diagrams without triggering construct jealousy or page-ward curses.\",\n        \"Deliver a set of flood-law precedents to the Archivists and a redacted diagram to the Syndicate.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Stone Librarian\", \"lines\": \"Breath is allowed if declared, and you will declare it as one declares a tool before opening a case: clearly, calmly, and without embellishment. Hands will be permitted if gloved, for oil is a vandal we have learned to recognize even in the dark, and we do not forgive easily when pages remember a touch that hurt them. Intention will be cataloged and returned in the same condition in which it was provided, or penalties will accrue according to the drowned index that we recite without air and without haste. You will not elevate your voice above the level of our lantern’s echo, for sound is a current here and every current is measured, weighed, and given back to the shelves that birthed it. Declare your name and your bindings, and we will weigh your passage as we weigh storms in jars and maps in the bones of fish. If what you seek is law, you will wear a cord whose knot speaks of witness; if what you seek is craft, you will knot for function and show us you know the difference.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jana Fell\", \"lines\": \"I have argued with judges and ledgers and once with my own conscience, and none are as stubborn as a library that has tasted its own mortality and decided it will not be fooled again. We must bring up what will keep our city from repeating Thren’s last page, and we must do it with gloves on our souls as well as our hands. Sing to the wind if it will listen, because even a bottled gale has ears for a right chord, and the hinges of Avarinth have always answered to music that respects the weight of water. If it will not listen, gag it with stone and law, for both were made to stop a thing that believes itself unstoppable, and both have stopped me in my youth when I ran too hot. You are to copy what must be copied and keep your shadow from touching what would follow you home; I will tie your intent to a witness-knot and you will feel it at your wrist like a pulse. When you return, we will divide truth from vanity and oath from rumor, and the city will have one less darkness in a place where the lamps cannot go.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Orren Halv\", \"lines\": \"I do not beg favors from statues, but I will give thanks to any rock that lets me read, because rock remembers the shape of pressure better than any clerk remembers the shape of a river’s mind. Fetch me the diagram for the western hinge-pivot, and give Jana her law, for I would rather be argued with by a clean page than by a flood that thinks it knows what it wants. If the constructs hiss at you, hiss back in proper chord, and they will either understand or prove themselves furniture, and I know how to move furniture. If they bite, bite harder with precedent, because teeth chip on statute when statute has been tempered in a calamity’s fire. Bring me a redacted copy that hides our safety tolerances from fools and saboteurs, and keep the breathing vellum from any who think reading it in a mirror makes them engineers. If you must choose between a perfect diagram and a living city, favor the city, and I will take my scolding from scholars with my hat off and my lamp lit.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Quay\", \"lines\": \"My knot is true and my cord is clean, and the witness loop lies on the inside of my wrist where I can feel it tighten if I lie to myself. I will take what I declare and leave no finger marks you can smell, and if I fail that, I will leave my name tied to the fault so it can be found and scolded by anyone with a better memory. If the wind tries to walk me where it wants, I will sing it into a chair and ask it to listen, because even angry weather understands a firm voice offered with respect. The pages will hear my breath but not my hunger, and if my shadow grows sharp, I will fold it like a sail and knot it to the floor until my work is done. I am riverborn and taught by roofs and ropes, and I have balanced worse ledgers than this one when the lamps burned red and the city pretended not to see. If Thren’s drowned law wants me to pay a tithe of time, I will pay it in patience and clean copies, and I will not take more than we agreed even if the shelves whisper my name like a familiar sin.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ink Eel Whisper\", \"lines\": \"Warm skin warm skin warm skin, the law is meat if we close our eyes and float inside the dark that tastes like iron and old coins. Bleed a little and we will tell you the secret names of the hinges, and we will wind them around your knuckles like ribbons that bite when you pull too hard. Don’t bleed and we will tell the water you are rude, and the water will tuck you into a pocket behind a sigh and forget where it put you for a hundred bell-chimes. We learned to read by drinking spills and mistakes, and we love mistakes best because they hum when you put your ear to them. Stay still and we will comb your hair with our small teeth and leave you smooth as a page that has been forgiven by the sun.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Present the perfect visitor cord and a full shelf catalog\", \"text\": \"Neris double-checks the visitor cord, fingers counting the witness loops and the catalog knot where shelf numbers are tucked like seeds. The cord is offered palm-up, never thrust, and the catalog is spoken in tide-order with every shelf named and every intention admitted. Even the purpose of the redaction for the Syndicate is acknowledged as protection rather than deceit, and the language is careful the way one is careful with glass and tempers. Neris bows to the stone librarian’s lantern as if it were a living flame and recites a breath-declaration learned in the Basilica’s vestibule. The final touch is a humble question asking the library to amend the catalog if a safer route presents itself, which flatters the Archive’s pride without pretending to teach it anything.\", \"outcome\": \"The stone librarian accepts the cord and adds a single counter-knot that reads as both blessing and leash, assigning a silent procession of glimmerfish to guide the route and measure the voice. Passage feels like a ritual rather than a trespass, and construct jealousy cools to professional interest that watches but does not interfere. Ink eels drift closer to listen to the careful words but do not harry the gloves, sensing that impatience would be punished by the very shelves they nest beneath. Copying proceeds with a quiet that returns itself to the room, and page-wards blink in slow assent when the mirrorglass trace kisses their scripts without smearing. At the end, the librarian exacts a tithe of time in the form of a short recitation to a cracked anthem tile, which records Neris’s breath for future scholars and sends the party away with the sense that they were weighed and found appropriately dense.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Invoke Syndicate authority and press for rapid access\", \"text\": \"Orren’s seal is shown first and the voice is pitched in the register of engineers who have slept too near flood-gates and learned to speak over thunder. The catalog is abbreviated and recited in functional shorthand, and the visitor cord bears a new knot that reads like a command more than a request. Neris keeps posture tall as a gantry and names the danger of delay, painting the bottled wind as a liability that will cost the Archive more pages if not silenced. There is respect in the words but not much softness, just the crisp logic of men and women who close teeth of basalt against a tide that wants to swallow their neighbors. The final sentence offers a reciprocal favor in the city above, and the lantern flashes in the cadence of power rather than petition.\", \"outcome\": \"The stone librarian steps aside but its lantern narrows to a slit of measured disapproval, and a second construct begins to pace two aisles over like a magistrate who expects to be needed. The air-pressure tides start to pulse faster, as if the Archive itself holds its breath against the tone, and the ink eels gather with a whispering curiosity that thrums in the ribs. Copying is still possible, but page-wards stiffen and a mirrored panel turns its face away so that reflections cannot sneak extra glances. When the hinge-song is needed later, the room remembers the command and resists the lullaby, so the bottled wind bites once before it can be caged. The work is finished on time, but a rumor travels upward in the bubbles that a Syndicate seal leaned too hard on a sacred place, and Jana’s trust needs mending with a clean citation and an apology tied in public cord.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Close the bottled wind with song and measured stone\", \"text\": \"Neris chooses the hinge-phrase taught by rain and rope, testing the pitch against the gantry-bones of memory until a resonance wakes in the mask itself. Basalt weights are set like quiet commas around the rift, each placed on a pulse rather than a point the eye would pick first. The song begins low and patient and then rises through the tones that tides answer, not as command but as pact sworn in breath and labor. The bottled wind seethes in its cracked prison and then curls like a scolded animal, finding that the song names its shape more gently than glass did. Every word is a muscle that refuses to panic, and the final note is allowed to fall into silence like a page turned without a fingernail’s scratch.\", \"outcome\": \"The rift tightens around the weights with a sigh that feels like a page being shelved correctly, and the pressure-tide eases until the lamps’ cold flames stand steady. No stacks topple and no loose scripts go kiteing off into the dark, and the vellum with breathing runes lies where it can be gathered like a found breath. The stone librarians incline their heads a thumb’s width, which is as close to applause as stone grants, and they recite an addendum that unlocks a safer corridor to the hinge diagrams. The lake keeps a memory of the voice, however, and a future visit will wake the echo like a name called in a stairwell, recognizable to friend and watcher alike. Orren’s note arrives later with grudging praise for not cracking anything that should have bent, and Jana ties a pearl-white knot on the witness cord that hums when Neris sleeps.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Trace the hinge diagrams by light alone and redaction by knot-code\", \"text\": \"Instead of touching the pages, Neris angles the Mirrorglass signal mirror to pull pale skeins of light across the diagrams, letting the lines print themselves into memory like reflections taught to walk. Each segment is copied onto inkroot parchment above the waterline with a scribe’s patience and an archer’s steadiness, and omissions for public safety are encoded not with ink but with a sequence of corded tags. The tags read as harmless bookmarks to the untrained eye, but their spacing tells any archivist where a dangerous measurement has been softened, hidden, or deferred to licensed engineers. A labradorite tile is set near the copies during transcription so that lies, if any, would show as a dimming of the stone, and the stone keeps its glow with a quiet, pleased breath. The final bundle is twofold: a complete, sealed set for Jana with a notation of every choice, and a Syndicate copy with redactions tied so neatly that only a reader of knots will know where the truth is coiled.\", \"outcome\": \"The constructs accept the light-tracing as a compliment to the Archive’s mirrors, and no jealousy pricks from page-wards unused to gentleness; in fact, a living pane in a nearby hall turns its face to see more. The truth-tile warms when oaths are spoken over the work, and ink eels drift away to hunt sharper thrills, bored by the lack of panic and blood. The Syndicate’s engineers find their redacted diagrams perfectly sufficient to rebuild a pivot in a storm without giving saboteurs the exact tolerances they crave, though one sharp-eyed aide suspects craft in the knots. Jana files the full copies in a sealed sleeve with a cord that sings softly when handled, and she adds a footnote praising the method as a precedent for future salvage from jealous stacks. Somewhere in Brightreach, the Mirrorglass Collegium hears that light can trace what fingers may not, and a new argument begins about who owns reflections when reflections begin to think.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M07\"], \"next\": [\"M09\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Hinge-song slate fragment etched with a waking chord, a chipped piece of Thren’s notation that hums true when a gate should stir and stays mute when a fool would force it.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Labradorite truth tile (glows when oaths are spoken sincerely), its seam-fire shimmering like moonlight trapped under rain.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Tidewrights’ Syndicate (begrudging respect) for clean redaction, steady hands, and a voice that coaxed pressure into peace rather than spectacle.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"access\", \"description\": \"One supervised visit to a sealed Archivist vault, a lantern-lit hour among pages that remember storms and forgive only the careful.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
