A thousand clever throats beat the air with caws, clicks, and knot-syllables while mirror-kites blinked along their tethers, catching and flinging back the city’s thoughts. Neris Quay climbed the net-ladders with the old river-balance, grey eyes tasting the light as if it were an eddy to be read, and found Thay Nerr in a balcony shadow, his coat smelling of smoke, seed, and bought secrets. He spoke of a stolen lexicon of bird-calls fenced through a hidden bench near Dyers’ Spiral, of a flurry of forged calls braided to a Red Gale pattern that would make the Tide-Hinge Bastion bite down during a public truth-lens spectacle. The Mirrorglass Collegium, proud as prisms, would mount their living pane and teach the crowd to fear their own reflections, and in that theater the backward-burning memory of a single moon-flame could be coaxed to the surface like an eel. Somewhere between the honey smoke of the Saffron Ledger Exchange and the brine mist of Chainreach, someone had learned to rent the sky like a hall, and to choreograph truth and panic in the same minute’s breath. Mistress Caw’s birds had learned too many human voices and would repeat whatever phrase smelled most like attention, so the city’s gossip had become a kind of fuse, fibrous, thirsty, and dangerously well-knotted. Neris carried the ache of old rope-burns and the small bright grit of a mirrorglass shard in the eye, and knew what it was to be a signal at the wrong moment. To dull a weapon without breaking it, you sometimes ground a new edge, and sometimes you cupped the blade in cloth and waited until the cut forgot to be sharp. So the archer crossed roofs slung with dyed cloths that bled saffron in the dusk-damp, slipped beneath countinghouse galleries where ledger-embers warmed ink into confession, and listened to the soft machinery of a city that made law from light and debt from color. The Hinges’ counterweights rose like ribs above the canals and ticked the hour in iron commas; every gantry spoke a different syntax if you knew how to read the lamp grammar. Down in Dyers’ Spiral, benches sold hues, rumors, and the power to tint a vote from blue caution to saffron flame, and the thieves there handled information the way good boatmen handle rope—smooth palms, soft voices, and no sudden pulls. At the Conservatory’s prism-tower, students with smoke-shaded eyes rehearsed the experiment that would peel light into principles, while in Brightreach’s gutters, mirrors threw back nonsense on purpose to see who might believe it. Neris strung the Sel-Reed Riverbow with moon-resin care, not for killing but for the old work of stitching distance—arrow to rope, rope to rail, rail to safety—and swore to keep informants masked and guilty lamps bared. A plan wants a rhythm like a tide, and the city had taught Neris how to count to slack water without looking.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Recover the stolen lexicon of bird-calls from a hidden bench dealing secrets near Dyers’ Spiral, prying it loose from dyed shadows and polite knives without burning the Rookery’s sky-rights.\",\n        \"Decode the false-signal pattern intended to trigger an emergency hinge-closure during the Collegium’s truth-lens demonstration, mapping each counterfeit caw to the Red Gale grammar until the trap reads itself aloud.\",\n        \"Persuade or bribe Mistress Caw to ground mirror-kites at the critical window, or substitute a harmless call that soothes the aviaries while the city’s breath is held between lamps.\",\n        \"Sabotage or redirect the truth-lens demonstration so protected informants are not exposed while still exposing lamp-color tampering, turning the spectacle toward stains only the guilty can see.\",\n        \"Secure a recording—avian or optical—tying dye futures in the Saffron Ledger Exchange to Red Gale hoaxes, a confession with feathers or glass that even Parliament lamps must acknowledge.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Thay Nerr\", \"lines\": \"Everyone wants to own the sky because light is a habit for the eye, and habits can be priced, mortgaged, and sold back to you with interest. Someone will take my birds’ good tongues and lace them with a Red Gale’s panic while the Collegium makes a righteous noise about truth, and the Bastion will close its teeth right on cue. You can clip wings, but clipped wings grow back badly; better to teach a new song whose pauses are the important parts, the way a tidewright reads slack water between surges. Bring me the stolen lexicon, because a throat with no dictionary is just noise, and noise is safer than language when language is weaponized. Do this without teaching the priests to preach at me, archer, because gratitude I can pay, but sermons cost too much time and make birds nervous.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mistress Caw\", \"lines\": \"The birds mimic what they hear too often, like children and politicians, and lately the city has been shouting in colors instead of sentences. If I ground the mirror-kites, you will have an hour of quiet sky that smells like a storm that forgot to arrive, and in that quiet a thousand thieves will wonder which roofs we are watching. If I let them fly, their wings will carry a word that cuts the wrong throat, because a sharp whisper is braver than a dull warning when the lamps burn high. You can buy my patience with fennel-scented seed and a promise I can knot into a perch post, and if your promise holds I will teach the rooks to swallow a syllable at the fatal moment. Do not teach my flock to lie; teach them to wait until the river remembers which way it wanted to go.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Glassmaster Pel Korr\", \"lines\": \"The truth-lens is a tool, not a god, and its ethics are in the hands that point it, the way a river’s virtue belongs to the one who opens or closes a gate.

If someone intends to crash a hinge for theater, I will break their mirrors and display the shards in the Conservatory’s forecourt as a lesson in optics and governance. Keep your birds on their perches and your hands steady, archer, because if you twitch at the wrong moment you will change the interference pattern and unmake my careful calculus. Aim me at what deserves to be seen—lamp-color fraud, market-stained flames—and I will make the city’s eye focus there and nowhere else.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Factor Lisi Jhak\", \"lines\": \"I am tired of being accused by those who cannot balance a ledger except with borrowed candles, yet I am never tired of proof that can live through cross-examination and fire. If there were hoaxes timed with trades, they would have been the work of fools who mistook volatility for competence, and the Compact does not hire fools to hold our scales. Bring me evidence that sings in rook-throat or gleams on mirrorglass, and I will burn the culprits myself to cauterize the market and keep the dye-lines from snapping. Bring me rumor, and I will buy it cheap to keep it from growing teeth, then sell it back to Parliament with silk wrapped around it. Remember, archer, that a market is a hinge that opens to trust and closes on fear, and I would prefer my hinges well-oiled and predictable.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Quay\", \"lines\": \"Give me the lexicon and I’ll make the sky say nothing at the right time, because silence is also grammar when spoken by a flock. I will not let truths become knives in the wrong ribs, not while I still carry rope-burns that remember the cost of timing. If the lens must teach, let it teach the color of coin when it stains a lamp, and the way panic tastes when sweetened by futures. I will stitch roofs to railings and kites to perches with arrow and cord until the city breathes on count, and the Bastion keeps its teeth for storms rather than theater.

Explain that silence is not treason but surgery, a controlled stillness to keep a dangerous word from spreading. Promise to return the birds’ sky at the exact chiming of the lantern bell and to leave a mirrored cistern open for their play as recompense. Share the decoded fragments of the counterfeit Red Gale grammar so her rooks learn to spit out those syllables if they ever hear them again. Assure her that no rook will carry lies, only delays, and that delays can be the difference between a clean rescue and a flooding court.\", \"outcome\": \"Mistress Caw knots your promise into a perch and grounds the mirror-kites, the aviaries settling like a sea after squall while handlers hum the waiting song. The false-signal cascade starves without wings, and the Bastion crews hear only ordinary traffic during the truth-lens show. Word spreads that you purchased silence rather than stole it, and housetop clans mark you as a respectful climber, though some Rookery rivals mutter that you traded sky-time for favors. Caw’s goodwill becomes a line of credit in feathers—useful later when birds must ferry something heavier than rumor. However, the temporary hush makes certain whisper-mongers nervous, and one of them shadows you toward Dyers’ Spiral, convinced you are hiding a louder secret.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Rook’s Descent, Ledger’s Rise\", \"text\": \"Slip into Dyers’ Spiral under dyed canopies where saffron drips in threads of scent and coin, and locate the hidden bench that sells meanings by the ounce. Study the bench’s knot-code—the way a finger rests on a cord, the weight of an elbow near a ledger stone—and wait for the fence to recite a harmless rook-call that really means ‘deliver.’ Follow the courier through spice-steam and countinghouse laughter, then take the lexicon with a hook-arrow that pins a rope without tearing it, hauling the satchel into a canvas awning like a fish into a net. Leave payment in the form of a forged rumor stamped on inkroot that leads any pursuit into a cul-de-sac of mirrors, buying you the minutes needed to vanish across a balcony of drying silks. Before you go, touch the ledger-ember with a gloved finger and feel the heat where futures were cooked alongside the birds’ grammar, so you know which hands to watch when you surface.\", \"outcome\": \"The lexicon rides your shoulder like a quiet rook as you traverse rain-slick tiles, and the secret bench discovers too late that its words have flown. A brief chase sputters along awning edges, but your knot-hook arrows write commas into the pursuit, and the Riverborn balance turns alleys into slow water. Inside the lexicon you find notations in two inks, one of them Compact-standard and the other the shaky hand of an amateur splicer—proof that a market mind hired a clumsy accomplice. The fence curses you by name and by clan you never joined, and a distant watcher in a dye-proof cloak files your silhouette in their memory. With the book back in Rookery hands, decoding the false-signal pattern becomes a task of patience rather than guesswork, and you earn Thay Nerr’s thin, expensive smile.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Red Gale Rewritten\", \"text\": \"Set up on a Brightreach cornice with the mirrorglass signal mirror cupped in your palm, the Conservatory’s tower a clean line across the canal. Break down the counterfeit call into its bones—three sharp uplifts, a held breath, and a fall like a dropped pin—and compose a counter-signal whose harmonics eat those edges. Teach a pair of juvenile rooks the null-call by whistling through the Ash-Veil mask, letting the soot-filters round your tone until it is more absence than note. Time your flashes to the Collegium’s rehearsal cadence and the Parliament clock’s second bell, so the Red Gale sees nothing but a slack-water echo when it tries to form. Write the pattern in the lexicon’s margin for the Rookery’s use, and seal it with amber so it will not rot when soaked in panic.\", \"outcome\": \"When the false calls begin, they find a net made of silence waiting, and their teeth close on air. Tide-Hinge Bastion’s signal crews glance toward the gantries, see no green flare, and keep their sequence steady, more by instinct than by trust in luck. A murmur crawls along Brightreach as several watchers feel the hair lift on their arms, the body knowing that a thing almost happened and did not. Your null-call enters the Rookery’s holy-of-holies with a new knot-name, and a handler whispers that you have taught the sky to ignore a command. The forger behind the hoax notices that his storm refused to arrive, and in his frustration he makes a mistake loud enough to follow back to his countinghouse cubby.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Lens That Sees the Stain\", \"text\": \"Approach Glassmaster Pel Korr with the courtesy owed to a man who believes light has manners, and show him the counterfeit Red Gale map without gloating. Propose a redirection: lace the demonstration with a benign interference filter that bends the living pane’s appetite toward lamp-color tampering rather than faces, a nudge rather than a shatter. Offer to place decoy screens that carry the silhouettes of protected informants somewhere the lens will not bother to look, an alley of ghosts that cannot be tracked to living throats. Agree on a gesture—a simple arrow-salute—that tells you when the lens locks to the stain you want, so you can pull the birds down for the minute of revelation. Swear, on no one’s religion but your own rope-burned memory, that you will not let the lens be blamed for human cruelty.\", \"outcome\": \"Pel Korr’s assistants shuffle lenses like cards until the living pane huffs and settles, reflecting what it wants within the corral you two draw. When the demonstration begins, the pane blossoms not with names and tradecraft but with the bruise of contaminated lamp-fuel and the ghost-hand that swapped colors in the Hall of Many Lamps. The crowd inhales as one, and a Parliament clerk nearly faints when a matched stain blooms on his ledger sleeve where gloam once splashed. Informants remain shadows among shadows, while the guilty glow like fresh dye under audit, and the Collegium earns applause instead of threats. Later, in a quiet corridor lined with mirrored tiles, Pel Korr nods once and says you have taught a lens that even truth works better when aimed.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C5\", \"title\": \"Market Confession\", \"text\": \"Meet Factor Lisi Jhak above the Saffron Ledger Exchange on a gallery that smells of heat-reactive ink and victory, and place a rook on the rail where it can listen. Lay out the chain you followed: the stolen lexicon’s second hand, the Red Gale spoof timed to vote-bells, and the peculiar way dye futures swelled like gills when panic was sold. Offer her a choice—public scandal that burns through the Compact’s silk or a contained purge whose smoke still teaches the city to watch lamp-fuel. Slide across a mirrorglass tile that remembers a reflected face near a forged signal lamp, and let the rook imitate the voice that ordered the hoax in a whisper too precise to dismiss. Tell her you will take proof to Parliament lamps regardless, but you prefer a market that bleeds in private once rather than in public forever.\", \"outcome\": \"Lisi Jhak’s jaw tightens, not in fear but in arithmetic, and she signals for a brazier to be lit as if warmth might clarify the soul. She listens to the rook recite the hoaxer’s command and recognizes one of her lesser factors, a talent she misjudged as clever when he was only reckless. She takes your evidence, burns the implicated contracts to ash, and signs a sealed confession admitting that dye futures were once tied to falsified Red Gale alerts, phrased as a cautionary tale and stamped with her authority. You copy the rook-call into your amber-sealed tube and send a duplicate to the Rookery benches where silence can be bought, not rented, and where debts are tabulated in feathers. The Compact survives chastened, the market steadies with a shiver, and your name circulates in two colors—one for the truth you brokered, and one for the profit you did not take.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M09\"], \"next\": [\"M11\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Rookery sky-rights token for emergency use during one vote night, a corded ring stamped with a black feather that grants lawful passage across rooftop aviaries and priority in mirror lanes for a single bell.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"evidence\", \"description\": \"Recorded rook-call confession linking dye futures to Red Gale events, captured on a tuned mirrorglass tile and countersigned by a Rookery handler for admissibility before Parliament lamps.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Rookery of Whisper-Brokers debtor’s grace, an owed silence and three favors feather-marked under Mistress Caw’s ledger that soften beaks when your name is spoken.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"knowledge\", \"description\": \"Insight that the living pane beneath the Mirrorglass Conservatory has been trained with faces from Parliament’s west gallery, meaning it will prefer certain reflections unless gently redirected.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
