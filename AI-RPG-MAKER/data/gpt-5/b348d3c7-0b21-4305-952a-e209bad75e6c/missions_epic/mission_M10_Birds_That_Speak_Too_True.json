  "description": "At the crown of Skyline where the wind wears feathers, the Rookery Spire rose like a basalt finger scribbling notes into the low clouds. A thousand clever throats beat the air with caws, clicks, and knot-syllables while mirror-kites blinked along their tethers, catching and flinging back the city’s thoughts. Neris Quay climbed the net-ladders with the old river-balance, grey eyes tasting the light as if it were an eddy to be read, and found Thay Nerr in a balcony shadow, his coat smelling of smoke, seed, and bought secrets. He spoke of a stolen lexicon of bird-calls fenced through a hidden bench near Dyers’ Spiral, of a flurry of forged calls braided to a Red Gale pattern that would make the Tide-Hinge Bastion bite down during a public truth-lens spectacle. The Mirrorglass Collegium, proud as prisms, would mount their living pane and teach the crowd to fear their own reflections, and in that theater the backward-burning memory of a single moon-flame could be coaxed to the surface like an eel. Somewhere between the honey smoke of the Saffron Ledger Exchange and the brine mist of Chainreach, someone had learned to rent the sky like a hall, and to choreograph truth and panic in the same minute’s breath. Mistress Caw’s birds had learned too many human voices and would repeat whatever phrase smelled most like attention, so the city’s gossip had become a kind of fuse, fibrous, thirsty, and dangerously well-knotted. Neris carried the ache of old rope-burns and the small bright grit of a mirrorglass shard in the eye, and knew what it was to be a signal at the wrong moment. To dull a weapon without breaking it, you sometimes ground a new edge, and sometimes you cupped the blade in cloth and waited until the cut forgot to be sharp. So the archer crossed roofs slung with dyed cloths that bled saffron in the dusk-damp, slipped beneath countinghouse galleries where ledger-embers warmed ink into confession, and listened to the soft machinery of a city that made law from light and debt from color. The Hinges’ counterweights rose like ribs above the canals and ticked the hour in iron commas; every gantry spoke a different syntax if you knew how to read the lamp grammar. Down in Dyers’ Spiral, benches sold hues, rumors, and the power to tint a vote from blue caution to saffron flame, and the thieves there handled information the way good boatmen handle rope—smooth palms, soft voices, and no sudden pulls. At the Conservatory’s prism-tower, students with smoke-shaded eyes rehearsed the experiment that would peel light into principles, while in Brightreach’s gutters, mirrors threw back nonsense on purpose to see who might believe it. Neris strung the Sel-Reed Riverbow with moon-resin care, not for killing but for the old work of stitching distance—arrow to rope, rope to rail, rail to safety—and swore to keep informants masked and guilty lamps bared. A plan wants a rhythm like a tide, and the city had taught Neris how to count to slack water without looking.",
  "objectives": [
    "Recover the stolen lexicon of bird-calls from a hidden bench dealing secrets near Dyers’ Spiral, prying it loose from dyed shadows and polite knives without burning the Rookery’s sky-rights.",
    "Decode the false-signal pattern intended to trigger an emergency hinge-closure during the Collegium’s truth-lens demonstration, mapping each counterfeit caw to the Red Gale grammar until the trap reads itself aloud.",
    "Persuade or bribe Mistress Caw to ground mirror-kites at the critical window, or substitute a harmless call that soothes the aviaries while the city’s breath is held between lamps.",
    "Sabotage or redirect the truth-lens demonstration so protected informants are not exposed while still exposing lamp-color tampering, turning the spectacle toward stains only the guilty can see.",
    "Secure a recording—avian or optical—tying dye futures in the Saffron Ledger Exchange to Red Gale hoaxes, a confession with feathers or glass that even Parliament lamps must acknowledge."

    { "speaker": "Thay Nerr", "lines": "Everyone wants to own the sky because light is a habit for the eye, and habits can be priced, mortgaged, and sold back to you with interest. Someone will take my birds’ good tongues and lace them with a Red Gale’s panic while the Collegium makes a righteous noise about truth, and the Bastion will close its teeth right on cue. You can clip wings, but clipped wings grow back badly; better to teach a new song whose pauses are the important parts, the way a tidewright reads slack water between surges. Bring me the stolen lexicon, because a throat with no dictionary is just noise, and noise is safer than language when language is weaponized. Do this without teaching the priests to preach at me, archer, because gratitude I can pay, but sermons cost too much time and make birds nervous." },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Caw", "lines": "The birds mimic what they hear too often, like children and politicians, and lately the city has been shouting in colors instead of sentences. If I ground the mirror-kites, you will have an hour of quiet sky that smells like a storm that forgot to arrive, and in that quiet a thousand thieves will wonder which roofs we are watching. If I let them fly, their wings will carry a word that cuts the wrong throat, because a sharp whisper is braver than a dull warning when the lamps burn high. You can buy my patience with fennel-scented seed and a promise I can knot into a perch post, and if your promise holds I will teach the rooks to swallow a syllable at the fatal moment. Do not teach my flock to lie; teach them to wait until the river remembers which way it wanted to go." },
    { "speaker": "Glassmaster Pel Korr", "lines": "The truth-lens is a tool, not a god, and its ethics are in the hands that point it, the way a river’s virtue belongs to the one who opens or closes a gate. We have safeguarded informants before with curtains of harmless glare and corridors of shadow arranged like music, and we can do so again if given time and honest diagrams. If someone intends to crash a hinge for theater, I will break their mirrors and display the shards in the Conservatory’s forecourt as a lesson in optics and governance. Keep your birds on their perches and your hands steady, archer, because if you twitch at the wrong moment you will change the interference pattern and unmake my careful calculus. Aim me at what deserves to be seen—lamp-color fraud, market-stained flames—and I will make the city’s eye focus there and nowhere else." },
    { "speaker": "Factor Lisi Jhak", "lines": "I am tired of being accused by those who cannot balance a ledger except with borrowed candles, yet I am never tired of proof that can live through cross-examination and fire. If there were hoaxes timed with trades, they would have been the work of fools who mistook volatility for competence, and the Compact does not hire fools to hold our scales. Bring me evidence that sings in rook-throat or gleams on mirrorglass, and I will burn the culprits myself to cauterize the market and keep the dye-lines from snapping. Bring me rumor, and I will buy it cheap to keep it from growing teeth, then sell it back to Parliament with silk wrapped around it. Remember, archer, that a market is a hinge that opens to trust and closes on fear, and I would prefer my hinges well-oiled and predictable." },
    { "speaker": "Neris Quay", "lines": "Give me the lexicon and I’ll make the sky say nothing at the right time, because silence is also grammar when spoken by a flock. I will not let truths become knives in the wrong ribs, not while I still carry rope-burns that remember the cost of timing. If the lens must teach, let it teach the color of coin when it stains a lamp, and the way panic tastes when sweetened by futures. I will stitch roofs to railings and kites to perches with arrow and cord until the city breathes on count, and the Bastion keeps its teeth for storms rather than theater. If debts are owed after, I will tally them in the open, because hidden ledgers have already cost us enough nights." }
