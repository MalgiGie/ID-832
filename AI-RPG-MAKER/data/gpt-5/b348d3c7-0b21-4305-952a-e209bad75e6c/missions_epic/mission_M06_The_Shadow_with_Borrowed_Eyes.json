    "description": "Brightreach glittered as if someone had spilled a basket of small moons across the paving stones, every shard-fed mosaic clutching stars and holding them with proud fingers of grout. Students in smoke-shaded goggles drifted like cautious moths between pavilions whose glass roofs sighed with the weight of morning, and every lantern flame seemed to lean closer to listen as if gossip had found a brighter tongue. Glassmaster Pel Korr received Neris Quay beneath the prism-tower where light fell through colored planes and made the floor a compass of burning petals, his smile keen enough to slice silence into obedient strips. He spoke of a focusing prism missing from its cradle, a carefully tuned child taken from a nursery of dangerous siblings, and of Sav Orlai, a student whose shadow had learned how to arrive late and then, at last, how not to arrive at all. Rumor rings carried by mirror-kites said the tracks of that strayed silhouette pointed toward the Glass Spine Ridge, a place that sang at midnight until ceilings trembled far away in the Hall of Many Lamps and mirror-lurkers woke hungry for new reflections. On the ridge, dawn light caught on a thousand sharp faces and turned speech into something clumsy and too loud, so walkers learned to move with the ringing and not against it, breathing between notes the way a pilot slips between eddies. If Sav’s shadow had been listening to living glass, the way kites listen to wind, then it might have learned the first terrible courtesy of voices: how to speak back to lamps and to the city itself. The hinge-song of Avarinth was delicate as oath-cord when wet and loud as truth when burned; one cracked note at the wrong hour could set Parliament glass to spidering and wake sleepers who should never turn in their vaults. Neris’s task was a braid of obligations: follow glints and delayed footprints along the ridge, find what had been taken, still the music that threatened the city’s ribs, and coax a wayward shadow home without letting a single hair on the student’s head be harmed.",

            "lines": "Light is a better liar than any politician, but only because people are such eager mirrors, and I have made a career of asking lies to tell me what they fear. Sav’s shadow learned a trick before their hands did, and now it spies better than our best lenses, slipping under doors the way moonlight steals a keyhole. The prism missing is a child among sharper children, and without it our exhibition will be a dark house pretending to be a lighthouse, an embarrassment that will cost us not just applause but contracts and the city’s patience. Bring me both, and I will owe you more than a lecture, more than a signed letter for your Rookery friends; I will tune your mirror until it hears the softest throat of dawn. Break either, and I will teach the city to misremember your face, for reputation is simply light that has been trained, and I write the curricula for its lessons. Remember this also: the ridge’s midnight music is unschooled sound, a choir of broken glass that tries to become a law; if you can quiet it, my gratitude will arrive like noon across a frost field and stay until everything melts."

            "lines": "I did not ask for my shadow to leave, but I did wish on a cooling lens that I could hear what the lamps say when we aren’t listening, because sometimes I think the city coughs and we pretend it is applause. If it is wrong to want the city to speak to me, then call me wrong, but don’t call my shadow a thief, because wanting a conversation is not stealing the mouth that might answer. It learned to love edges, and edges rarely love back, yet they sing to those who balance on them and I have balanced too long over questions no one else would ask. People say a shadow is obedient darkness, but mine has a memory and a temper; it stayed after I left rooms, then it started arriving late, and then it started leaving first as if we were a quarrel. If you see it, tell it I’m sorry I taught it to arrive late and that I should have taught it how to return, and that I never meant for it to go somewhere so sharp it could be hurt by its own looking."

            "lines": "Shadows run where ropes hesitate, and I have thrown more lines than I have told truths, but both require the same breath and the same timing, so I will choose my breaths carefully. I’ll bring yours home, Sav, and if the prism has learned pride, I’ll remind it that pride is heavier than glass can carry, especially when the wind is made of songs and the ground is made of knives. The ridge sings like a mouth full of shards; I’ll move when it exhales and be gone between notes, counting rings the way I count lantern flashes in a storm. I have seen mirrors eat a person’s outline and spit back a rumor, and I have cut cords that wanted to be laws; I will not let either happen to you. If your shadow asks for a promise, I will give it a knot that can be untied, and if it asks for a home, I will point to the place under your feet and the place behind your heart, because those are the only rooms that never go dark."

            "lines": "The Rookery hears your ridge singing through kites cut finer than silk, and birds don’t tell lies unless we pay them extra or starve them of news, which is its own expensive sin. If the music cracks Parliament’s vault, rumor prices climb until a bird can buy a bench and I can buy a conscience, and neither purchase would end well for anyone who has to live between those benches and that conscience. Stop the song and I will owe you a discount on discretion, which is to say I’ll forget things at wholesale rates and remember your name the way a rook remembers the hand that fed it well. Let it play and you will owe me the story of why, and stories accrue interest faster than dye-futures when a storm is coming, so do not borrow if you cannot pay with hours you don’t have. One more thing, arrow-runner: the shadow that learns to listen will learn to repeat, and when a city hears itself from the wrong mouth, it pays thieves to cut tongues and pays poets to sew them back with prettier thread."

I do not like a hinge that dreams, because a dreaming hinge forgets the weight of water and the value of minutes, and forgetfulness is a kind of flood. Return with the prism, and return with the song stuffed in your pocket if you can, because our signals should be the only music these gates hear, and even our music is a discipline rather than a pleasure. The ridge rings in cycles the way a good crew breathes in cycles; step on the beat and you will walk like a whisper, step off and the wind will take your skin like a tax collector. If your work brushes the Rookery or the Collegium the wrong way, remember this: our lamps color law, but our hinges color life, and I will color my gratitude bright if you keep both from cracking."

            "text": "You choose to treat Sav’s shadow not as a misbehaving appendage but as a fledgling listener who fledged too soon. You climb into the Glass Spine Ridge at first light, counting the ringing intervals until the blade-winds slacken, and arrange polished shards into a small amphitheater that faces no one and everyone. In the pauses between notes you speak as a tidewright would to a gate, test words for leakage, and tell stories of homes that stay open even when doors must shut. When the shadow gathers at the edge of your boots like spilled ink reconsidering its stain, you offer it a knot-cord soaked in moon-resin that hums with a promise that promises can be undone. You do not command; you invite, and you admit your own debts aloud so the shadow can weigh them and decide if your balance is sound.",
            "outcome": "The shadow slides up the cord like dusk climbing a mast, slow then swift, and the knot takes its weight without snapping or smoking, which is as close to applause as cord magic permits. In return for respect, it shows you where the focusing prism nestles in a pocket of living glass that reflects what it wants, and together you distract the pane by making it admire its own refusal long enough to lift the prism free without a shiver. The midnight music softens because you ask the shadow to sing a counter-hum, and it obeys because you left a space in your voice where it could rest; the ridge’s ringing returns to weather instead of law. Back in Brightreach, Sav takes their shadow’s hand like a lover who has been told a hard truth and thanks you with tears that fall in quiet rather than in crisis; Pel Korr watches the reunion with a scholar’s envy and a craftsman’s relief. The Mirrorglass Collegium names you a technical confidant in public, the Rookery sells a cleaned version of the tale in private, and Gantrix Pell nods once in a way that means the Bastion will sleep easier for a time."

            "text": "You choose craft over parley and prepare a lure that any wayward silhouette that has learned to love edges cannot ignore. From the Basilica market you secure a small coil of moon-resin cord, not sanctified but honest, and you smear it with lens-polish until it smells like the warm breath of a lantern. At the ridge you hammer three basalt pegs between singing shards so your stance stays true even if the blade-winds test your ankles, and you raise a mirrorglass panel tuned to Sav’s gait from boot scuffs observed in the Conservatory’s dust. You then play back those silent steps by rocking the panel on its hinges, creating a familiar absence the shadow mistakes for home coming around the corner. When it arrives with cautious hunger, you cast the cord as if throwing a rescue line, and the knot cinches around what it cannot see but you can feel like cold on a tooth.",
            "outcome": "Bound, the shadow flails like a thought trapped by grammar, but the moon-resin hum soothes it, and you speak to it through the cord, promising return rather than surrender until its thrashing becomes a shiver and the shiver becomes stillness. The focusing prism lies within arm’s reach because a mirror-lurker had been stalking it; your quick binding draws the lurker’s attention to the humming knot instead of your hands, and a well-placed blunthead from your riverbow cracks the creature’s reflection-sense before it can scream. You time your retreat to the ridge’s quieter measures, letting the ringing cover your footfalls and the winds carry away the smell of moon-resin before predators associate it with meat. Back in Brightreach, Sav accepts the corded shadow with trembling fingers and, under Pel Korr’s supervision, unties it slowly until it pours back under their heels like a promise forgiven; the student will remember the hum when fear tries to scatter them again. The ridge’s midnight music is not silenced but damped by the cord you leave looped around a keystone shard; Gantrix Pell warns that a proper solution will be needed soon, yet she grants you the credit for pushing a crisis far enough ahead that Parliament ceilings do not crack this season."

            "title": "Enter the Ridge at Dusk and Steal the Song",
            "text": "You choose to address the source of the midnight music first, wagering that sound is the shadow’s true leash and that silence will loosen it to return. At the threshold of dusk you grease your climbing claws with soot so they won’t chirp against the milk-quartz, and you climb until the ridge’s broken comb sings loud enough to vibrate your teeth into a new bite. There, among shards that remember storms as if they were lovers, you set your mirrorglass signal mirror to catch the ringing and throw it back inverted, turning crescendo into hush the way a pilot turns whirl into glide. The living pane that reflects what it wants tries to take your face, but you set the mirror at an angle that lets it keep an echo of you while you keep your name, and in that compromise it grows sleepy with self-regard. In the quiet that follows, with the ridge breathing like a tired choir, you find the focusing prism resting in a cradle of cooled lightning glass, and you coax Sav’s shadow from its hiding by offering a bargain written in knots and in the deliberate slowness of your own footfalls.",
            "outcome": "When the song is stolen into your mirror and flipped into a private silence, the mirror grows heavy as a sin you intend to confess someday, and you wrap it in dark cloth so it does not bruise the air. The ridge’s predators drift away like thoughts that require noise to feed, and the shadow, deprived of its orchestra, folds thin enough to travel inside the prism’s long reflection where it keeps company without being dissolved. At the Conservatory, Pel Korr takes the prism with a sigh that sounds like a bow across glass but returns it when he sees the shadow pause inside the facets; he realizes the exhibition can wait one night if a student’s outline needs a more careful hour. Sav breathes into the prism, fogging it with apology and gratitude, and the shadow loosens and spills back to its rightful ground, heavier now in a way that suggests it has learned the cost of listening. Later, Gantrix Pell tests the Bastion’s teeth and finds them still, while Thay Nerr buys the story of how you turned a song into a weight and sells it as a parable about debts that must be carried with both hands; your name, for once, is told without the garnish of scandal."
