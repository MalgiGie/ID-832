        "description": "Lean, sun-browned archer with canal-weathered hands and a boatyard stance. Tar-black hair is braided with a copper thread for luck; grey eyes catch light like wet slate. Wears a dye-proof cloak cut short for rooftop work and a corded bracer for quick arrow-knots.",
        "distinctive_signs": "Old rope-burn scars along forearms, a rook-feather tattoo behind the right ear, and a tiny shard of mirrorglass speckling the left iris from a Glass Spine ridge mishap."

    "class": "ARCHER",
    "history": "Born in Lowwater beneath the Hinges, Neris Quay learned balance long before letters, crossing stall roofs to run messages when the canals flooded. A River-Marrows pilot father taught current-sense; a mother who dyed sailcloth in Dyers’ Spiral taught color and patience. Neris apprenticed briefly to the Rookery as a sky-runner, where the bow became both tool and oath: line-arrows to throw rescue cords, bluntheads to crack signal lenses, bodkins to pin ropes without fray. On a red-sky evening during a sudden drawdown at Chainreach, Neris shot a knot-hook through the Speaker’s barge rail and hauled it true, earning the wary gratitude of Talo Ren. Archivist-Mother Jana Fell later contracted Neris to ferry sealed flood-writs and scout the Sunken Archive’s margins, where stone librarians watched with lantern-cold eyes and ink eels nosed at boot-leathers. Broker Thay Nerr of the Rookery refined Neris’s value, trading in quiet recoveries and louder rumors, and taught a lesson: in Avarinth, a signal is a blade if timed right. Neris now moves between wards and factions, a rooftop archer whose arrows stitch islands in emergencies and unpick knots when politics tangle. The city’s lamp-colors have begun to feel like weather to Neris, and weather can be read, ridden, and sometimes rewritten.",

He values Neris’s neutrality but will sacrifice it for Parliament if flames turn against him.",

    "ambitions": "Broker a practical truce between the Tidewrights and River-Marrows over trade-hour hinge openings, codified by Archivist countersign and Basilica knots; design rescue protocols and signal lanes that outlive politics; clear the Quay family’s salvage record at the Weir to earn lawful pilotage for a future crew.",

    "dreams": "To craft a bow that throws lines of light strong enough to stitch the Hinges in a storm; to map a safe, repeating route through Thren’s drowned stacks; to retire to a Skyline roof-garden where lanterns burn without politics.",
    "secrets": "On a vote-night panic, Neris swapped a moon-flame for a backward-burning fake provided by Thay Nerr to stall a flood-tax, buying hours for a dock strike and triggering illegal closures that cost lives. The justificatory cord was forged using brown-ink techniques learned watching the Archivists, and a hidden maker’s mark in the fibers can tie the forgery to Neris. Jana Fell may already suspect, and Talo Ren’s debt would invert if proof surfaces."
