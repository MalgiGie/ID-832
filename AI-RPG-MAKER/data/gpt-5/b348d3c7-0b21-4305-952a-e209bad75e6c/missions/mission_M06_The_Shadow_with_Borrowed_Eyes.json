    "description": "The Mirrorglass Conservatory’s courtyards glittered with mosaics capturing constellations, and students shuffled like shy moths behind smoke-shaded goggles. Glassmaster Pel Korr’s smile was sharp as a cut and twice as reflective when he explained that a focusing prism for the equinox had been stolen and a promising student’s shadow had ceased to obey. Tracks led toward the Glass Spine Ridge, where midnight music threatened to crack vaulted ceilings in the Hall of Many Lamps and to draw mirror-lurkers from their lairs. The ridge’s facets caught dawn like fish-scales and made speech feel like a noise too loud. If the shadow had learned to listen to living glass, it could learn to talk back to lamps.",

        "Track Sav Orlai’s shadow from Brightreach to the Glass Spine Ridge using reflected glints and delayed footprints.",
        "Recover the Conservatory’s stolen focusing prism before the Collegium’s equinox exhibition.",
        "Investigate and, if possible, dampen the ridge’s midnight music before it fractures Parliament vaults.",
        "Avoid mirror-lurkers and blade-winds by timing movement with the ridge’s ringing cycles.",
        "Return Sav Orlai’s shadow to its owner without harming the student."

            "line": "Light is a better liar than any politician, but only because people are such eager mirrors. Sav’s shadow learned a trick before their hands did, and now it spies better than our best lenses. The prism missing is a child among sharper children, and without it, our exhibition will be a dark house pretending to be a lighthouse. Bring me both, and I will owe you more than a lecture. Break either, and I will teach the city to misremember your face."

            "line": "I did not ask for my shadow to leave, but I did wish on a cooling lens that I could hear what the lamps say when we aren’t listening. If it is wrong to want the city to speak to me, then call me wrong, but don’t call my shadow a thief. It learned to love edges, and edges rarely love back. If you see it, tell it I’m sorry I taught it to arrive late."

            "line": "Shadows run where ropes hesitate. I’ll bring yours home, Sav, and if the prism has learned pride, I’ll remind it that pride is heavier than glass can carry. The ridge sings like a mouth full of shards; I’ll move when it exhales and be gone between notes."
