    "description": "Spray feathered the Pilgrim’s Stair like lace, and candlelight flowed upward in a slow river of penitence and stubbornness. Exiled Prior Senne Vell waited by the lion’s mouth spring with salt cakes and eyes that had outstared exile, asking Neris to guard a quiet parley with Rector Mera. The Stair’s old magic demanded questions be asked in tide-order, and zealots with knotted wrists had been policing what could be asked for too long. The Fifth Knot’s return could mend a schism that had frayed every oath-cord in the city, yet there were hands eager to saw at any bridge before it could hold. Even the stone underfoot felt the question: which vows should bind a city that has learned to survive by untying itself when necessary?",
    "objectives": [
        "Escort Senne Vell from the hidden landing to a mid-stair niche without zealot interference.",
        "Keep to tide-order Q&A with Rector Mera to soothe the Stair’s superstition and avoid a bad omen.",
        "Retrieve a stolen cord from a zealot cell intent on humiliating the Fifth Knot during the parley.",
        "Help tie a provisional reconciliation knot that hums truth when brought near Parliament lamps.",
        "Ensure the return route remains unobserved by rival factions."

I do not ask for triumph tonight, only for a question to be heard without a fist closing over it. Walk beside me like a shadow that happens to be brave. If the Stair hums approval, you may feel it through your boots."

            "speaker": "Rector Mera",
            "line": "I will not pretend I did not dread this meeting, Senne. Pride is a harder knot to unpick than any a novice ties wrong on their first day. Yet the city needs both a law that can bind its flood and a mercy that can forgive its runaways. Neris Quay, you will keep our circle unbroken. Should zealots test us, remind them that knots tied in fear unravel in blood."

            "speaker": "Zealot of the Purist Knot",
            "line": "The Stair has room for truth but not for traitors. You come to untie a penance only because the city has learned to love its own bending more than its backbone. We will not see the Fifth Knot crawl back under a rain of candles to bind a weaker law. Turn away, or be counted with the compromisers when the lamps burn white for judgment."

            "line": "I’ve stood on hinges that sing when storms roll in, and I’ve watched ropes hold a barge whose owner was praying to every god but gravity. A good knot is not a prison. It is a promise that holds shape when wind and water argue. Ask your questions in the right order, and I will keep anyone from answering with knives."

            "speaker": "Senne Vell",
