    "description": "The northern channels choked and shifted like a sulky throat, and the River-Marrows muttered about dying trade while the Syndicate waved charts that said patience. Harbormother Ysra Dokk and Pilot-Captain Rull Fen asked Neris to help chart a new safe lane through treacherous silt and to capture a saboteur faking Red Gale signals to crash dye prices and justify emergency closures. Lanterns in Lowwater burned a little dimmer every night because silt slowed the coalboats, and rumor made coin out of hardship. The river does not care whose faction has the right lamp color; it cares who understands its teeth. Tonight, the city would learn whether an archer could stitch a truce where engineers and boatmen had been untying each other for years.",
    "objectives": [
        "Place four discreet buoys that only River-Marrows can read, creating a safe lane through the shifting silt bars.",
        "Decode a pattern of false Red Gale signals and trace them to their origin point without alerting the culprit.",
        "Apprehend the saboteur and present them to a neutral witness from the Order of Knotted Light.",
        "Draft a preliminary co-authority knot witnessed by the Order that grants River-Marrows input on trade-hour hinge openings.",
        "Deliver lane charts to both Syndicate and Marrows to force a shared solution."

If a red lamp lies to us, it is not a safety law, it is a theft with a hymn. I want your arrows to stitch a path that does not answer to a single guild bell. Do this, and I will clear your family’s record as far as my tide will reach."
