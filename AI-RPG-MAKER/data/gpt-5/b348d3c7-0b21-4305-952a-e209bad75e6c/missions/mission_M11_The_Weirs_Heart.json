    "description": "Upstream, the Shattered Weir of Sel rose like the jawbones of a river-titan, iron rings big as wagon-wheels biting slick stone. Between those cyclopean teeth, eddies snarled and undertows inverted boats with spite, and chain-ghouls hunted by vibration like hungry harps. Rull Fen and Orren Halv agreed for once: a salvage run must bring back a slate etched with a hinge-song said to wake sleeping gates anywhere on the Sel, and perhaps an amnesty writ lost in a pearl-crusted reliquary. The Weir smelled of stormlight and old breath, and Neris’s family name caught on the wind like a piece of old rope snagged on a ring. If a heart still beat here, it was a lesson in rhythm and remorse.",

        "Search for and recover a Parliament amnesty writ sealed in a pearl-crusted reliquary on the lowest floor.",
        "Survive a sudden drawdown by anchoring to pre-fall iron rings and timing release with the river’s pulse."

Help me pull a clean song out of this toothy throat and I will stamp a charter that lets you pilot with your name unbent. The river remembers fairness when you shout it in the right key."

We need that waking chord, not for power but for safety that does not rely on fear. Bring me the slate, and I will write the co-authority you want into a schedule that reads like math, not like mercy. Bring me excuses, and I will bring you edicts."
