    "description": "Ash fell in veils that drifted like memories trying to find a face, and the Caldera’s basalt organ-pipes boomed with breath from the earth. Pyre-Mistress Kael Ibrin offered Neris a mask that smelled of soot and a job that smelled of politics: escort a basalt caravan, broker a pause with drake-tamers at the warm vents, and collect an obsidian core needed to tune Parliament’s truth-lamps. The Wardens believed the ash remembered shapes, and this veil remembered Neris, or at least someone who had once chosen a backward-burning truth. When the wind changed, glass-ice formed on exposed skin and whispered guilt. The caravan’s ropes creaked like conscience.",

        "Retrieve an obsidian core suitable for ritual blades and lamp tuning from a vent-ring.",
        "Protect the caravan from ash drakes hunting from the high rim.",
        "Deliver basalt and obsidian to Chainreach and Brightreach respectively."

            "line": "Ash lies and tells the truth in the same breath; it shows you faces you miss and debts you prefer to miscount. Keep your veil tight and your heart steady. If you must pick which breath to save when masks run thin, remember that miners without wind bring down cities just as surely as broken vows. Return with rock and calm, and I will write you a route through our stockpiles without tariff."

We will share warmth if you do not steal names for your Parliament lamps. Bring us salt and a promise not to hunt our broods with vanity blades, and you may pass. Bring us a trick and we will teach the ash your scent."
