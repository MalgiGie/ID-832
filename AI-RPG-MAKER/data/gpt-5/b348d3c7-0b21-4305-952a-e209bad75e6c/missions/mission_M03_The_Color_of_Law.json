    "description": "In the Hall of Many Lamps, votes smell of oil and fear, and tonight the dye-lords had sent their best colors to persuade the floor. The flood-tax would decide whether the Syndicate could shutter hinges during trade hours without triple countersign, a decision worth fortunes and perhaps bodies. Talo Ren’s gratitude for a saved barge weighed visibly on his shoulders as he asked Neris to watch the flames rather than the faces. Rumors whispered of moon-resin fakes that burned backward, a tricked light capable of swinging a count by the hue of a heartbeat. In the high galleries, a mirrored passage breathed softly with eavesdroppers, and the basilica’s knots hung like patient judges. Politics felt like a narrow quay in a storm: too slick to stand still and too crowded to run.",
    "objectives": [
        "Inspect the fuel and wicks of the vote-lamps for moon-resin adulteration before the floor bell rings.",
        "Shadow the mirrored listening passage and note any Rookery brokers coordinating the timing of interruptions.",
        "Decide how to handle a discovered forged moon-flame: expose it publicly to Ista Brine, or swap it silently to prevent a scandal without implicating allies.",
        "Protect Talo Ren during the vote from a staged stumble designed to spill saffron dye onto tally cords.",
        "Deliver your findings to either the Speaker or the Archivists for record."

I have not forgotten the line you threw that day, nor the way Parliament pretended it was wind that steadying us. Tonight I ask for your eye more than your string. If a flame lies in this hall, I must know before I light the count, or I become another man who says flood to hide theft. Help me keep this vote upright, even if it tilts the world against me tomorrow."

Do not play priest with fire in this hall, archer. The law tolerates a quiet swap only when the alternative is blood. If you choose theater over order, be ready to bow with the actors."

I have no patience with insinuations dressed as safety, and less with clerks who mistake dyecraft for sacrament. Walk carefully and do not slander what keeps your ward-lamps lit. The market punishes lies as surely as any god."

I do not tell you this as a man with a stake in the outcome, though I admit that I have a stake in every outcome. You have been a very precise storm when I needed one, Neris. Remember that sometimes rescuing a law from itself requires a hand no one sees. Decide whether you want gratitude or righteousness, and accept the price."
