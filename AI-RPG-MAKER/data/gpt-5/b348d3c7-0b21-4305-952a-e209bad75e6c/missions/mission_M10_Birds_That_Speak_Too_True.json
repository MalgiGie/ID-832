    "description": "The Rookery Spire’s aviaries throbbed with caws and clever silences, and mirrored kites winked like insects over Skyline. Thay Nerr admitted to Neris that a lexicon of bird-calls had been stolen and a flurry of false signals would soon trigger a hinge-closure during a truth-lens demonstration staged by the Collegium. A living pane of glass under the Conservatory had begun reflecting what it wanted, and if allowed to perform, the truth-lens might out more than informants—it might show a backward-burning flame from a certain night when docks were spared and other lives were not. Mistress Caw stroked a rook that imitated voices uncannily, a little parliament of birds rehearsing consent and dissent alike. The city’s language had become a weapon, and Neris was asked to dull it carefully without breaking it.",
    "objectives": [
        "Recover the stolen lexicon of bird-calls from a hidden bench dealing secrets near Dyers’ Spiral.",
        "Decode the false-signal pattern intended to trigger an emergency hinge-closure during the Collegium’s truth-lens demonstration.",
        "Persuade or bribe Mistress Caw to ground mirror-kites at the critical window, or substitute a harmless call.",
        "Sabotage or redirect the truth-lens demonstration so protected informants are not exposed while still exposing lamp-color tampering.",
        "Secure a recording—avian or optical—tying dye futures in the Saffron Ledger Exchange to Red Gale hoaxes."

Someone will use my birds to tell your Bastion when to hold its breath during a show that should have been a lesson, and then Parliament will pretend that truth arrived by accident. You can either clip wings or teach them a better song. I know which choice earns gratitude and which earns sermons. Try not to make me owe a priest."

            "line": "The birds mimic what they hear too often, like children and politicians. If I ground them, the city loses its gossip and gains a silence that smells like preparation. If I let them fly, they will carry the word that cuts the wrong throat. You can buy an hour of quiet with a promise you can keep, and with a pouch of seed that smells of fennel. Do not teach my rooks to lie; teach them to wait."

We have safeguarded informants before; we can do it again if given time and clear corridors. If someone intends to crash a hinge for theater, I will break their mirrors and display the shards as a lesson in optics. Keep your birds on their perches, archer. I will aim the lens at what deserves it."

If there were hoaxes timed with trades, they were the work of amateurs who do not understand futures. Bring me proof, and I will burn it myself to keep the markets from catching. Bring me rumor, and I will buy it cheap and sell it dear."
