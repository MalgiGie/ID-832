        "description": "Lean, salt-browned archer with kelp-black hair braided in tight cords, sea-gray eyes, and callused hands inked with faded brine glyphs. Wears bone-scale pauldrons over a reef-cloth coat and carries siltglass goggles on a pearl-cord.",
        "distinctive_signs": "A crescent pearl-splinter scar along the jaw, lumenkelp threadwork tattoos that dim and brighten with the tide, and a right ear cuff carved from whale-tooth etched in listening sigils."

    "class": "ARCHER",
    "history": "Born among the fishers of the Bonebridge Isles, Kael learned to loose bone-fletched shafts at mirror-crabs across wind-cut channels. A flood year drove their clan into Thassyl, where the Children of the First Shell fed them and taught oaths of safe harbor. As a youth, Kael apprenticed on the Spine Market hauling for the Siltglass Syndicate and learned to read brine glyph stakes the Tidemasons set along safe roads. A Brinewarden scout-muster took Kael into service under Captain Ysger Thorn as a deck-archer and lookout during corsair seasons. Kael gained a reputation for silent shots and fast signal work, guiding cutters by lumen arrows during squalls. After a crackdown on lanternless night-walkers that spilled into a soup line at the Sanctum, Kael confronted the chain of command and resigned the pike. Matron Asha Heliope of the Lumin Weavers hired Kael as a procession guard and night guide, trusting a steady hand to keep glow rites safe through the Whisper Mangroves and along the Spine. Between contracts, Kael runs messages and scouts reef cuts, keeping an ear for the Fathom Tongues’ warnings and an eye out for Gray Sail tricks. A dive at Moonlock Reef with an old friend, Ilya Salt-Kite, revealed a pocket of phosphor coral that thrummed off-pulse and a carved groove that might match the legend of the Moonkey pearl. Since then, Kael has balanced Brinewarden favors, Weavers’ obligations, and the dangerous goodwill of smugglers while the city tightens knots over pearls, glass, and the sea’s will.",

    "secrets": "Kael keeps a resonant shard lifted from a drowned passage of the Thalassarium that can mimic a fragment of the Tongues’ chord rumored to open a hidden Tide Loom bypass. On a fog night, Kael also altered the Moonlock signal pulse to draw Brinewarden cutters away from a Weavers’ procession—and accidentally cleared a channel a Gray Sail skiff used to slip a tariff line."
