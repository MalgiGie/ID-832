      "description": "Night lowers over Thassyl like a careful hand, and the bones of Veloros hold the city’s breath as if balancing a secret on the tongue. Lantern-kelp wakes in blue-gold braids, weaving a patient glow along the Spine and down the marrow streets where brine glyphs drink any wayward drip of fear. The Tide Looms murmur and knock like old hearts finding a steady rhythm, and from the open mouth of the Thalassarium a hush gathers, listening for the chord that will tell iron, rope, and bone to be wise. Factions drift in on their different currents—the Lumin Weavers with light pinned to wrists and brows, the Fathom Tongues bearing coils of echo-stone and a tooth lectern polished by vows, the Tidemasons with keys on cords and pride pressed tight behind their jaws, the Brinewardens with steam-scored pikes held low at the hip like oaths you keep but do not flaunt. Kael Rimestrand steps into the seam where city and sea exchange courtesies, clutching a Moonkey sketch that hums in the pocket like a swallowed promise and an Echo-Baffle Coil that drinks stray sound like tide draws back foam. Tonight the city will not be commanded and it will not be tempted to sleep; tonight it will be taught to hear itself, and if the teaching takes, the Shellspire debate, the flow quotas, and the quiet war over pearls will be argued on stone that does not lurch. Mara Vell-Seren watches beneath a hood of pearl-luster, Oaric Bent counts heartbeat-intervals against gear clicks, and Tullis Nacrethane knots brine-wet cords, ready to bind any mouth that would swear lightly. Between them all is a thin road of calm, and Kael must walk it, arrow-sure, lantern-steady, voice measured like a tide that never forgets its shore.",
