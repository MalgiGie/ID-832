    "description": "Under the market’s clamor, a net of crawlspaces called the Gray Threads links a dozen secret caches. Night air here tastes like oil and old salt. Ilya asks Kael to descend and stop a shipment gone ugly: bell grenades lifted from the Embersalt Arsenal now sit in a smuggler’s crate, and a hotheaded runner plans to light a fuse under the Shellspire debate to make a point with a bang. Neris Bonehook, a Gray Sail captain with hands like fishhooks and a grudging respect for clean work, believes violence is bad for business and worse for orphans who sleep near blast walls. The Threads are narrow; one wrong step can turn a quarrel into a war. Kael must talk where he can and draw only when words run out of arrows.",

        "Identify which arsenal comptroller’s mark is stamped on the crate manifest.",
        "Turn the grenades over to a neutral party for safekeeping (Fathom Tongues or Tidemasons) without alerting Brinewarden patrols."

There’s a crate down there that hums anger when you put your ear to the wood.

That’s a pride that doesn’t turn on you."
