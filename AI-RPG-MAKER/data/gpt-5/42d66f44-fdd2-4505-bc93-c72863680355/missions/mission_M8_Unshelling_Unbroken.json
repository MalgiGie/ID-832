    "description": "Day of Unshelling: the city crowns a shell-mother effigy and casts a woven carapace into the lagoon to appease the sea’s temper. Drumlines echo down the Spine and brine glyphs flash as water is coaxed into hidden wells for the pageant. Rumor says someone will spill bell grenades into the crowd and blame the Brinewardens to sway votes for the Shellspire. Mother Tullis asks Kael to watch the effigy’s path, guard the orphan cadres who carry offerings, and find any caches that smell of salt-cored powder. Arno Kest and his guild parade glass pennants to prove loyalty; Ysger Thorn puts pikes at the corners with orders to hold but not strike. The sea waits like a judge with its hand over the verdict.",

        "Protect the orphan cadre and ensure the Unshelling carapace reaches the water unscathed.",
        "Deliver any captured agitators to neutral custody at the Thalassarium."
