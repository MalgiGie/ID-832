    "description": "The Spine Market hums like a hive under nets that rattle in the salt wind. Pearl Row glitters with moonlust while ledger-scribes dip brine pens and argue margins. Whispers of counterfeit marks and altered tolls skate along the stalls like fish. Ysger Thorn, equal parts salt and stubborn, asks Kael to shadow Gray Sail runners along the Gray Threads beneath the market and to gauge who profits if fear of smuggling spikes before the Council debates the Shellspire. Mara Vell-Seren of the Pearl Compact has eyes in every polished shell; she might notice a familiar jawline in the crowd and offer a quieter coin. Arno Kest of the Siltglass Syndicate squints over purity marks and resents cheap foreign glare more than he resents the Brinewardens, which is saying much. The market is a storm where words are oars and credit-shells are anchors; if Kael rows wrong, he drowns in paper.",

I do ask you to carry your eyes through Pearl Row and come back with rope I can pull without drowning a ward. The Gray Sails are growing clever, but clever is just another kind of rust if you pour salt on it long enough."

I can fund a patrol boat for the price of a tariff, and I can sink a rival with a rumor. What I cannot do is abide thieves cutting pearls out of my rights with counterfeit stamps. Walk with me, archer. I pay for silence as easily as for speech."
