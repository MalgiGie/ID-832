    "description": "Moonlock Lighthouse’s pearl-lens turns light into a pulse that beats with the moon. Between the third and fourth blinks there is a shadow that means a smuggler cove to those who know the code. Sirae Glowhand has been fighting a false chorus at sea luring whales and small boats alike toward rocks, and she needs Kael to help retune the lens to swallow the shadow and answer the chorus with a harmless hum. Arno Kest arrives to defend the Syndicate’s claim on the lens’ purity, while a Brinewarden signal-master mutters about protocols. If Kael admits he once altered a pulse to draw cutters away from a procession, old arguments will rush the stairs like a squall. The lamp room smells of oil, salt, and stubbornness.",
