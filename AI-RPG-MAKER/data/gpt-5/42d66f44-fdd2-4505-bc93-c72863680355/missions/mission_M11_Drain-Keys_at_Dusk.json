    "description": "Dusk stains the Spine a bruised purple. Word comes that Verrin Nasse, Keyholder of the Tidemasons, plans to test the bypass during a timed dim-out and drain the Spine Market to prove the need for unprecedented emergency powers—backed by Mara Vell-Seren’s promise of loans and a secret dividend of pearl rights. Rusk’s jam will slow the water but not stop a determined hand with two keys and a chorus in his pocket. Ysger asks Kael to intercept the keys, expose Mara’s ledger pact, and keep the Loom from coughing a ward into the tide. The Embersalt Arsenal tightens its doors while Brinewardens take up stations along the jawbone quays. The city leans, waiting to see which way to fall.",

        "Hold the Loom’s bypass wheel at the service gallery until Rusk’s jam fully sets.",
        "Confront Verrin Nasse and persuade or force him to stand down.",
        "Present the keys and ledger pact to the Council guard for immediate injunction."
