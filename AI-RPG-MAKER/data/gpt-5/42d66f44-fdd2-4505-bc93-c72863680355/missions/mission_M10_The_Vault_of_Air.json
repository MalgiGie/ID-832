    "description": "Low moon. The reef’s torc opens as if remembering a mouth. Guided by the off-pulse map and the tuned echo-stone, Kael and Ilya set the Moonkey into the carved groove. The water shudders, then stills, and an ancient vault exhales air that tastes like old songs. Inside ribbed stone and coral scrollwork, a memory waits: a hum like a giant’s heartbeat, and murals that show Veloros turning his bones to a harbor so his kin could pass in peace. The vault contains no treasure, only instructions—a notation of the Long Note, a single chord that would set the city to walk if sung entire, and fragments of warning verse that drown a mortal throat. Rival divers hover at the door with knives that look small in the face of history. To leave with truth, Kael must decide how much of the Note to carry and whom to trust with it.",

        "Drive off or negotiate with rival divers who attempt to seize your findings.",
