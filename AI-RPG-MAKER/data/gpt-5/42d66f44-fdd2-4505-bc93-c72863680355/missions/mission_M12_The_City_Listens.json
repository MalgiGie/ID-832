    "description": "The Long Note’s fragments lie chalked on Thalassarium stone, and the city’s factions look at one another through steam and suspicion. The false chorus has gone quiet, the siphons breathe steady, and the Shellspire debate hangs by a thread. Asha Heliope proposes a pact: a night procession of light to encircle the Tide Loom halls while the Fathom Tongues hum a safe chord that will settle the mechanisms into a temper that resists sudden hands. Kael must place the Moonkey sketch at the right resonant point, lead the Weavers’ lines through the Spine without panic, and stand at the lectern tooth while the Listener Triad draws a verse that promises the sea respect without surrendering the city’s bones. Mara watches; Oaric listens; Mother Tullis binds oaths in brine. The choice is not to walk the city or to sleep it, but to teach it to hear itself again.",
    "objectives": [
        "Coordinate a joint rite between Lumin Weavers, Fathom Tongues, Brinewardens, and Tidemasons.",
        "Place the Moonkey Setting Sketch and the Echo-Baffle Coil at designated resonance points around the Tide Looms.",
        "Lead a calm procession around the Spine Market while maintaining order and light density.",
        "Support Tern Quietwake at the Thalassarium lectern to produce a stabilizing chord without invoking the Long Note.",
        "Negotiate a written accord for a neutral 'safe-cut' network and limits on unilateral flow changes."
