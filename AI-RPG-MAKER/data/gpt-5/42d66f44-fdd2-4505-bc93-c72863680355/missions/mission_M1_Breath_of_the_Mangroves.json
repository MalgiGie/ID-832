    "description": "At the fringe where Thassyl’s bone-arched lanes fall away into whispering roots, the Lumin Weavers prepare a night procession to reseed sanctuaries with lumenkelp spores. The Whisper Mangroves murmur warnings when fog lies low, and tonight the leaves hiss with a breath that chills the ribs. Pilgrims in nacre masks cradle living lanterns while children clutch prayer shells to their hearts. Asha Heliope knows the songs, the eddies, and the safe roots, but not the unseen hands that have been knotting reed-ropes across the channels to snare processions and steal their glow. She asks Kael to guide the procession by the white heron’s path, collect healthy spores, and listen for the names the grove sighs. If the grove speaks of drownings to come, the Fathom Tongues must be warned before the Unshelling draws half the city into the tide’s mouth. The air tastes of salt and copper; bone-eels slide in the knots and pilgrims whisper of a false chorus at sea that tugs like grief. The night will be beautiful, and it may break someone.",

Tonight we thread the mangroves with light, and I will not see one child traded to the fog for our carelessness. Walk with us. Keep the lanterns steady and the hearts steadier. If the grove speaks names, write them, even if one of them is mine."
