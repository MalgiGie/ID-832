    "description": "Beyond the jaw gates the sea spits scalding brine in white banners from the Saltfang Geysers. Tidemason scaffolds creak like old knees as wind-scoops gulp the plumes into troughs that feed mills and furnaces. Something has been jamming siphons with grit that isn’t silt and gnawing at seals with teeth that aren’t rats. The Order of Tidemasons swore an oath on a quiet vent: should their works fail through neglect, they will drink a bowl of salt to the dregs before the Council. Kael is charged with walking the ring with Oaric Bent, tasting the spray for iron, dodging iron-gnats that crave tools, and finding who salted the vent for a lie. Arno Kest’s people need pure rime-salt, and a single scald can sour a season’s glass. The vent field hisses like a room of snakes; the air is a mirror that burns.",

If the siphons choke, the mills cough, and the looms complain, people start praying where they should be patching. I don’t pray well. I patch. You, archer—watch with me, and tell me if you see a hand where a tide should be."
