    "description": "The Council at the Vertebrae glows with lumenlight diffused through fungal shades, and the air trembles with the expectations of wards crammed into spiral galleries. Fossil chandeliers pour history onto the present. Tern asks Kael to speak in his square voice and present proof: siphon sabotage flavored with foreign grit, a comptroller’s skim etched on a manifest, and reed-ropes set in the Whisper Mangroves. Mara Vell-Seren smiles like a tide going out and offers a room after, where bargains can be made in calm water. Mother Tullis rises from the back with orphans in orderly rows to remind the Council what a poor decision looks like when it is hungry. Ysger Thorn’s jaw works like a winch. The tuning passage behind the dais can make a whisper a roar if the right chord is set. Thassyl holds its breath.",
    "objectives": [
        "Present the Arsenal Manifest Page and Saltfang scrapings to the Council at the Vertebrae.",
        "Counter Mara Vell-Seren’s legal argument without slander by citing observed facts.",
        "Decide whether to reveal the existence of the tuning passage behind the dais to neutralize a hostile orator.",
        "Persuade the Council to delay emergency tolls until an inquiry into siphon sabotage concludes.",
        "Deliver a sealed copy of your testimony to the Thalassarium archive."
