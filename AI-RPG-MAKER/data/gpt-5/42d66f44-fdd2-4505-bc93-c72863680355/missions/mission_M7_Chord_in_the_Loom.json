    "description": "Deep under Thassyl the Tide Looms murmur like distant thunder. Rusk Bonebinder, hands cracked with salt and eyes full of patient worry, has found tool marks on a secret bypass panel few know exists—the kind of panel that can drain a ward during a bell’s length if married to a sung chord. He suspects Verrin Nasse, a Keyholder who keeps a smile for Council nights and a tin ear for floods, has been meeting late with pearl factors. To jam a bypass, Kael must fetch an echo-stone from Singer’s Trench that hums the right cancelling note and wrap it in silence wards braided by Sirae Glowhand. The trench will answer any sound with attention, and not all attention is polite. The Loom’s heart waits like a beast that will wake if you call it by its secret name.",

        "Install the echo-stone and silence ward on the bypass panel to jam unauthorized chords.",
        "Gather proof of Verrin Nasse’s unauthorized key use."
