    "description": "Moonlock Reef opens like a torc and closes like a fist. Inside its calm mirror, the phosphor coral pulses one beat wrong, as if a misplaced heart were trying to keep an entire reef alive. Tern Quietwake believes the off-pulse marks the groove of legend—the place where the Moonkey rests, a pearl not meant for jewelry but for song. Kael must dive with Ilya Salt-Kite, childhood friend with gray sails on their conscience and a laugh that makes danger feel like a dare. Rival divers in kelp-shrouds wait at the safe cuts with glass knives and lines, and the tides will change their minds mid-swim. If the wrong pearl is taken, breath itself becomes a liar; if the right one sits in the groove and the correct chord is sung, a vault of air will open and remember a titan’s voice. The reef hums with a bell-tone the ear cannot hear but the bones cannot ignore.",

Draw it. Touch nothing that your bones do not ask for twice. The sea has long memories and very little patience."
