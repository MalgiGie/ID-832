A flood year drove their clan into Thassyl, where the Children of the First Shell fed them and taught oaths of safe harbor. As a youth, Kael apprenticed on the Spine Market hauling for the Siltglass Syndicate and learned to read brine glyph stakes the Tidemasons set along safe roads. A Brinewarden scout-muster took Kael into service under Captain Ysger Thorn as a deck-archer and lookout during corsair seasons. Kael gained a reputation for silent shots and fast signal work, guiding cutters by lumen arrows during squalls. After a crackdown on lanternless night-walkers that spilled into a soup line at the Sanctum, Kael confronted the chain of command and resigned the pike. Matron Asha Heliope of the Lumin Weavers hired Kael as a procession guard and night guide, trusting a steady hand to keep glow rites safe through the Whisper Mangroves and along the Spine. Between contracts, Kael runs messages and scouts reef cuts, keeping an ear for the Fathom Tongues’ warnings and an eye out for Gray Sail tricks. A dive at Moonlock Reef with an old friend, Ilya Salt-Kite, revealed a pocket of phosphor coral that thrummed off-pulse and a carved groove that might match the legend of the Moonkey pearl. Since then, Kael has balanced Brinewarden favors, Weavers’ obligations, and the dangerous goodwill of smugglers while the city tightens knots over pearls, glass, and the sea’s will.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Spindrift Recurve\",\n      \"description\": \"A laminated bone-and-siltglass bow tuned to pull smoothly in damp air; its limbs are wrapped with salt-hardened reed to resist creep.
