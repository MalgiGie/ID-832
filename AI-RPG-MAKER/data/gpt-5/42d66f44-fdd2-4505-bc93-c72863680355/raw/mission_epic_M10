Kael Rimestrand, salt-browned bowman with sea-gray eyes and the whale-tooth cuff that hummed against his pulse, skimmed with Ilya Salt-Kite across the mirrored slate of the inner lagoon, their skiff nosing through lumenkelp flicker and bell-toned water. The off-pulse map they had charted in secrecy prickled with possibility, a lattice of cuts and eddies that would lead to a carved groove older than the city’s laws, and the tuned echo-stone in Kael’s pouch trembled like a heart that wanted to sing. The Moonkey pearl, luminous and quiet as a trapped breath, fit the groove as if guided by memory, and the sea around them shuddered, stilled, and drew a long, invisible inhale that tasted like old songs trapped beneath ribs. Air spilled from the revealed passage, warm and laden with salt-ghosts, and they descended into a vault of ribbed stone and coral scrollwork where murals laid out a tale of Veloros, not fallen but chosen to be harbor and wall so kin could pass unhurt beneath storms. There was no coin, no diadem, no golden hoard, only instructions etched by patient hands and careful fins, a notation of the Long Note that could rouse a city to walk the seabed, and fragmentary warnings that spelled doom for mortal throats bold or foolish enough to carry the whole chord unguarded. A hum, like a giant’s sleeping heartbeat, thrummed through the chamber and climbed Kael’s scars with a shiver, while outside the rival wake stitched ripples across the entrance, knives and glass-masks gleaming with promises of theft. In that breath-held place, decisions weighed heavier than anchors, and truth itself became a contraband more dangerous than bell grenades, for to carry it wrongly would drown the city in a new sort of tide. Kael would need steady hands, steady voice, and steadier judgment to choose what to copy, what to hide, and to whom the first breath of this rediscovered air should be given.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Travel with Ilya Salt-Kite to Moonlock Reef at low moon and locate the carved groove.\",\n        \"Set the Moonkey pearl and open the vault without disturbing the surrounding coral.\",\n        \"Study and copy the murals and notations of the Long Note without attempting to sing them.\",\n        \"Drive off or negotiate with rival divers who attempt to seize your findings.\",\n        \"Deliver your copies to the Thalassarium and secure a private reading with the Listener Triad.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Tern Quietwake\",\n          \"lines\": \"The sea keeps memories the way bone keeps marrow, and when you enter a memory you must walk as if each step is an oath.

If the vault yields a chord, remember that a single wrong note can turn a blessing into a knife, and a knife in the sea does not cut a thing so much as it invites blood. I ask you not to be brave but to be careful, and not to be clever but to be honest with your own breath. When you return, do not speak upon the Spine or in any house where ledgers blink like eyes, but come by the quiet stairs to the Thalassarium where stone drinks sound and we can lay the findings down like a sleeping child.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"speaker\": \"Ilya Salt-Kite\",\n          \"lines\": \"I have sailed after false lights and cheap promises, but this light is patient and it does not bargain, and that makes me more afraid than any blade.

Still, I am a courier with debts stacked like crab shells, and the Gray Sails listen for chances like gulls listening for dropped bread, so help me keep my head clear when hunger starts whispering. If the rivals come with glass knives and quick hands, I would rather spend breath on a warning than on a shout, and I would rather spend blood on a promise than on a boast.

Sing me awake for greed and I will walk you into a hunger so deep your bones will ring like bells under pressure, and sing me awake for mercy and I will lie down and be harbor again until mercy is spent. Take the measure of my Long Note with chalk and calm hands, for a throat that carries more than a breath of it will drown without water and call it fate.

The Compacts will dress you in fine words and the Syndicate will dress you in fine glass, but neither will dress the truth in anything but chains, and you know I am not sentimental about chains unless I hold the key. Leave me half the rubbings and we can both live to boast carefully, or refuse and I will prove that a knife is a kind of punctuation even in holy places.

If you seek a share, Neris, take the warning instead, because it will profit you longer than the rubbings will, and it will cost fewer bodies on hooks. I will copy what the vault allows and carry only the breath of it, and I will lay that breath where the Tongues can weigh it against storms and pride without a crowd to cheer them wrong.

Know that silence is not neglect here but preparation, and that preparation is a form of love that does not ask to be seen. In time, we will test each fragment against safe vowels and safe halls, and we will decide whether to ask Veloros to turn or to beg Veloros to rest, and we will do so without drums.
