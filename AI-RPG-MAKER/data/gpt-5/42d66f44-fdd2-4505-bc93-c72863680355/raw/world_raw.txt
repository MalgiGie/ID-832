"{\n  \"city\": \"Thassyl, the Ossuary Harbor, is a crescent city fused into the calcified ribs and vertebrae of Veloros, an ancient sea-titan whose bones breach a tidal lagoon of pale-blue brine; its avenues follow marrow channels and the high Spine Causeway, its docks lash to jawbone quays, and its neighborhoods cling to bleached arcs like barnacles. Founded by storm-scattered refugees after the Shatterwake, Thassyl learned to coax breath and bounty from the bones; the Order of Tidemasons laced the harbor with Tide Looms, bone-slung dams and gearworks that weave currents into mechanical strength, while Lumin Weavers seed lumenkelp in sluice-pools to bathe streets in living light. Trade flows through the Spine Market in pearls, siltglass, rime-salt, bone-ivory carvings, dried sailfish, and brine inks; the Pearl Compact broker moonpearls taken from Moonlock Reef, and the Siltglass Syndicate fires dunes into translucent blues and greens kissed with salt-whorls. The city’s law is nominally the Council at the Vertebrae, a chamber carved in a central bone ring where spokespeople from guilds, clergy, and ward captains convene under fossil chandeliers; in truth, the balance tilts with the tides between merchant coin, Tidemason locks, Brinewarden pikes, and prophecies coaxed from the deep by the Fathom Tongues. Festivals mark neap and spring tides, most revered of which is the Unshelling, when the Children of the First Shell crown the Shell-Mother effigy and cast a woven carapace into the lagoon to appease the temper of the sea. Thassyl’s streets are etched with brine glyphs that wick floodwater into hidden wells, its roofs netted against sky-raiders, its watchtowers tuned to whalesong so alarms travel faster than bells; smoke tastes of resin and salt, air hums with gull-crow calls, and alchemical lanterns wear fungal shades to dim or deepen glow on command. Dependencies are intricate: the Tide Looms demand constant bone-mending and algae lubrication; the siltglass furnaces need steady salt-vapors from the Saltfang Geysers; the fisheries rely on reed nurseries in the Whisper Mangroves; and the whale-road diplomacy of the Fathom Tongues keeps migration paths clear of corsair ambushes. Legends say Veloros did not die but chose to beach and lift the city from storms, and that when the deep choir sings the Long Note, the bones will stir and Thassyl will rise and walk the seabed to a safer horizon; rivals fear this myth is a lever to consolidate power and flood rival wards under the pretext of an exodus. Present conflicts knot around a new vein of moonpearls discovered under the reef lock, the proposed Shellspire Temple that would replace half the dockside shrines, and the Gray Sail Association of smugglers whose cheap foreign glass threatens the syndicate’s hold. Anyone who rules Thassyl must understand that water is both road and wall, bone is both house and memory, and every decision is timed to the tide.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Moonlock Reef\",\n      \"type\": \"reef\",\n      \"description\": \"A torc-shaped coral labyrinth that opens and closes with lunar pull, its inner lagoons smooth as mirrored slate;
