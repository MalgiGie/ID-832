    "description": "The Luminous Weir glows in its crescent, song-gates whispering in bronze. Gate-Choirmistress Rana Olt taps a rhythm on the rail while Archhydromancer Quill Vess stares through the tide-window, his water hand rippling to some unheard counterpoint. A hidden gate is answering to an unknown note—present in the pebble, present in the river, absent from every throat in the Order. To test the gate’s response, a ritual sounding must be made while crews hold back angry pilots demanding a different sluice schedule. Aren must guard the choirs, listen for sabotage, and decide how to tilt the gates when the river’s temper rises.",
    "objectives": [
        "Escort Rana Olt’s gate-choir to the specified song-gate and maintain a defensive perimeter during the sounding.",
        "Detect and thwart any sabotage attempts by radicals among the Ferrymen without igniting a riot.",
        "Help Quill Vess determine safe adjustments to the sluice in response to the unknown note’s pull.",
        "Record the unknown note’s harmonic overtones using a prism register for later study."

The gate pulses to a tone missing from our chart, like a step in a stair that wasn’t there yesterday. If we guess wrong, we drown a terrace; if we guess right, we learn the measure of a power older than our order. I need your eyes on my flanks and your sense for when a crowd wants to become a storm."

If you see a fingertip on our hilt that isn’t ours, cut it off kindly. Hold this prism register steady; it will burn pattern into light if we are clever and not unlucky."

If the river is asking a question, let’s not answer with our throats; let’s answer with our ears. The current always tells the truth, even when it kills."
