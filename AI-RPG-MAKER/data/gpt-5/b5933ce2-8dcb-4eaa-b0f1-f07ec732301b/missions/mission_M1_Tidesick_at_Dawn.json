    "description": "The saffron-scented courtyards of the Saffron Hospice ring with bell-tree prescriptions while fever-sick boatmen gasp in oiled shade. Night fevers are climbing along the Saffron Bank, and rumors say the choral notes leaking from the Luminous Weir are stirring dreams into storms. Jilai Sunquiet asks Aren to shepherd a clinic skiff through a contentious morning at the Iron Bank wharves, where Ferrymen anger at quarantine closures simmers hot. In the pocket of a delirious child, a pitted, glassy pebble hums when wetted, echoing the river’s buried song. The Brass Menders need peace on the docks, the child needs passage, and the city needs someone who can read currents in both water and people.",

I won’t ask you to break heads, only to keep them from colliding. A child came in from Lantern Bank with a stone that sang in her fist; every time water touched it, the note combed the fever in one direction, like fingers in wet hair. I hear the Weir’s song inside it. I fear where it came from."

Don’t ask us to drown alongside them."

Jilai, I’ll take the child and the pebble to the Archives. If the Weir’s voice is in this stone, someone should read the score before the city starts dancing to it."
