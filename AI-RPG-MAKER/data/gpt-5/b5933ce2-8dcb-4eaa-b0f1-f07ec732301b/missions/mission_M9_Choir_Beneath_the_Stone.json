    "description": "The Sunken Charterstone reveals a rib of glowing script at extreme low tide, like fish-bones of light in a dark belly. Quill Vess and Mereth Tydel stand on the same deck for once, their disagreement folded into a shared fear. Divers hear songs in dead languages that grant them gills for a night or debts for a lifetime. Oath-leeches slide toward broken promises with the patience of snowfall. Aren must descend under ritual to soothe the stone’s anger, retrieve a missing tile if the river permits, and return with an answer to the rumors: if the Charterstone is raised, will the city owe the river a king? If so, what could be offered instead?",

If we pry the old stone up, we may give the city calm waters for a century and sell our grandchildren to a crown none of us will live to kneel before. I would rather be called a coward today than an architect of shackles tomorrow."

Go down, Aren, and listen as an honest man does, with more questions than answers. If the river demands a king, let us think of a crown it cannot wear."

Tie me to your line and sing me down, and I’ll bring you up whatever truth the stone grants. If the river wants a king, maybe it will settle for a city that remembers its own name instead."
