    "description": "Fog ghosts along a gorge where the Moonbridge’s spectral arc glides into place on thirteenth-moon light. High Acolyte Mereth Tydel leads a procession bearing offerings to a drowned shrine and a small reliquary: the legal name of a scribe who wrote the city’s water charters, stolen by a moon-toll and trapped in wind. To win the name back, someone must cross where intent bends into need and pay a toll in secrets. The bridge chooses its price; it already took Aren’s true name once. On the far side waits a figure who matches Sava Deren’s missing child, grown sideways into memory, half rumor and half rain.",

        "Recover the scribe’s name and any wayward names held in the wind without triggering a year-and-a-day erasure.",
        "Return across the span and restore the name to the reliquary before the bridge fades."

We need that scribe’s name to unshackle a law the city forgot to be proud of. If we pay well, we earn clarity; if we pay poorly, we earn silence where there should be speech."

If the bridge shows me a child, I’ll bring back the truth wrapped in care, not in promises I can’t keep."
