    "description": "Amber reeds bow and whisper as the Gilded Marsh breathes with the tide. Mist-Warden Ollo Fen calls an oath-feast on a raft wide as a plaza: reed-cutters, shrine-keepers, and a trio of Temple singers try not to glare while eel-oil lamps spit. A census-boat has vanished near humming stands, and the Reedbound blockade will not lift until the shrine waters are recognized and the taxes eased. At dusk, a low hum rises through the sedge, and the reeds vibrate with a voice that feels like copper on the tongue. The Reed-Queen’s presence curls along the channels, and she will guide only if paid with copper and milk.",

        "Offer copper and milk at the humming stand to secure the Reed-Queen’s guidance.",

The city taxes our gardens like we don’t feed them in lean years, and the Weir starves our channels when it suits their charts. I don’t want war; I want the Temple to mark our shrines in ink that doesn’t wash out in rain. Help me bring the census-boat home, and we’ll show them how the marsh keeps its own ledgers."

If we can agree on where the shrine begins, we can fight for its recognition in the Conclave. Do not spill blood in humming water; it stains the note for a generation."

Ollo, I’ll carry your words upriver, but we’ll need more than song to carve them into ledgers. Bring witnesses, and let the river see us keep the peace while it hums."
