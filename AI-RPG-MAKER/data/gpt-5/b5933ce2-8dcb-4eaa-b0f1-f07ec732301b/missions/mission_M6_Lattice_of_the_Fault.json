    "description": "The Emberlight Forge-Cloister’s blue forges answer only to purpose, and Brina Coil’s voice cuts through clamor like a bell. She needs Aren to escort a neutral survey to the Obsidian Fault, where trapped stars shimmer in noon-dark and a sealed lattice pulses beneath stone. Seven-Kettle Syndic’s envoy, Thorek Brimvauld, waits with a frown like a chisel. The survey must map the lattice without breaking it, for Temple augurs warn it is a sealed hymn, not an ore vein. And yet Indigosatchel rumors whisper of a private clause, inked in shadow, to pry the lattice open and sell the city’s covenant by the pound.",

I don’t trust your Ledgerfolk nor your market queens, but I’ve seen an oath-bound man stand fast in flood. Draw me proof that your city won’t steal star-metal from under our noses while preaching restraint, and I’ll see your forges have salt and iron through winter. The lattice wakes when you lie to it; keep your words square."
