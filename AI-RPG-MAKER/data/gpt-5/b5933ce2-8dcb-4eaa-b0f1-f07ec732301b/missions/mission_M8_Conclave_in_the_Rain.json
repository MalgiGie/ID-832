    "description": "Copper-green spires prick a gray sky as the River Crown Citadel fills with damp cloaks and damp tempers. Steward-Moderator Iren Vask ushers Aren to the tide-window, where the river’s pulse seems to quicken when contracts are read. Indigosatchel pushes to privatize a stretch of the river wall; the Weir Order argues for dredging the Sunken Charterstone; the Reedbound demand shrine recognition and an end to barge taxes; dwarven syndics threaten embargo; and somewhere beneath, the unseen current of memory tugs at everyone’s feet. The scribe’s name sits in a reliquary like a loaded oath. What Aren says—and refuses to say—will tilt the city.",

        "Present the recovered legal name and testimony at the Rotating Conclave to stall Indigosatchel’s privatization push.",

        "Negotiate a temporary standstill between the Weir Order and Temple on dredging the Sunken Charterstone pending a joint ritual.",
        "Expose a sealed clause tying star-metal extraction to market leases without triggering a walkout."

You have walked the marsh and the weir and the moon-road, and that gives you a voice here no one can pretend not to hear. Use it. Do not burn the city to cauterize a wound we could stitch."

This isn’t theft of the river; it’s stewardship with a ledger. And before you rehearse your marsh-poetry, remember that we insure the boats that bring your herbs to market."

The scribe whose name I carry wrote a mercy into law after a flood; let’s remember that mercy when we draw lines on water that feeds us all. Give us time for a joint rite at the Charterstone, and if the river asks for a price we won’t pay, I will be the first to say so aloud."
