    "description": "In the rain-murmuring rooms of the Veilhouse of Whispers, debt-threads sway like kelp in a tide. The Night Ledger’s masked child tilts a scale and a single white page seems to breathe. Sorev Dusk admits the unthinkable: someone stole a pardon page—the Ledger’s most dangerous mercy. It is hidden in the Hollowwind Barrows among fluted vents and the unsingable harmonies of the Hollow Choir. If the thief speaks the page in the wrong place, blood-debts will erase the wrong names, and feuds will riot into the streets. Sorev needs Aren to retrieve the white page without letting the Ledger own the deed.",

        "Find the hidden ossuary niche where the white page is kept and retrieve it without tearing or speaking it aloud.",
        "Confront the thief and resolve the motive behind the theft, then return the page to Sorev Dusk with conditions."

The white page can end a debt the way rain ends dust, and it can also wash a street clean of names that should remain. Someone took it to be kind, and kindness wielded without craft can be the cruellest blade. Bring it back, and I’ll pay with more than coin; I’ll pay with silence where you most need it."

Retrieve the page, and I will see that it is not used to erase a truth the city needs. I know you burned a debt once; consider this a chance to temper the fire rather than douse it."

I will bring you your page, Sorev, but it won’t be yours to spend where it bloodies a kindness. It goes back to the shelf where even your knives hesitate."
