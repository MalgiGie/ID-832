Fever-sick boatmen lie in oiled shade, their brows beaded, their dreams thrashing toward a music only they can hear, and somewhere upstream the Luminous Weir murmurs a choral note that answers them like a tide remembering an oath. Aren Siltwarden stands between courtyard and river, reading the morning the way a pilot reads a channel: the angle of the sun on dye canals, the spatter of gulls on iron roofs, the way murmurs hush when brass tokens flash. In a child’s damp fist rests a pitted, glassy pebble that hums when water kisses it, the sound thin as wire and strong as chain, and each time it sings the child’s breathing finds a rhythm and then forgets it. The Iron Bank wharves smolder with anger over quarantine closures, and the Guild of Silver Ferrymen count lost coin like lost sons, ready to lash out at anyone who blocks their path to work or bread. Jilai Sunquiet asks Aren to guide the clinic skiff through that tindered stretch without sparks, to walk the line between mercy and commerce with the steadiness of a pole on slick pilings. It is a narrow work, a reedblade dancer’s task, and beneath it all runs a subtler current: the city’s old pact-song, the Weir’s living mathematics, and a rumor that the river itself is learning to sing in the throats of the sick.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort a Brass Menders clinic skiff from Saffron Hospice to the Iron Bank wharves at first light.\",\n        \"Defuse a confrontation between quarantined Ferrymen and hospice orderlies without violence.\",\n        \"Identify the source of a humming pebble found in a fevered child’s pocket and secure it for study.\",\n        \"Deliver the humming pebble and a brief report to Sila Jor at the Concordant Archives.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jilai Sunquiet\", \"lines\": \"Your hands are steady when others shake, Aren, and that is a rarer medicine than most apothecaries will admit. The bell-tree climbed two notes in the night and the fever climbed with it, and I will not have our yellow pennants torn down by men who mistake our lanes for chains. We ask you to stand on the skiff’s prow and make a bridge of your voice: not to break heads, but to keep them from colliding, because concussions of pride bleed longer than scalp wounds. A child came to us from Lantern Bank with a pebble clenched so hard that her nails scored her palm, and when we rinsed the grit from her fingers the stone sang a thin bright tone that combed her fever one way, like fingers in wet hair. Each time the note touched her, her breath found the river’s old beat, and each time it faded she shivered as if a tide withdrew; I hear the Weir’s cadence in it, and I fear what shore it wants to draw us toward. Take the clinic skiff at first light and wear our brass token where even anger can see itself reflected; thread between wharf-masters and workers the way you thread between stumps in the marsh. Keep our orderlies safe, keep the Ferrymen’s pride unbruised, and keep that stone in a dry pouch unless I tell you to wet it. When you reach the Iron Bank, do not let the argument become the story; let care be the story, and let us be remembered for listening before speaking. Then take the humming pebble to Sila Jor at the Concordant Archives with a clean report of everything you saw and heard, because if the river has begun to sing through stones, we need a listener who knows how to lower a memory on copper wire and bring it up unbroken.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sava Deren\", \"lines\": \"Hospice flags stop coin like a sluice stops driftwood, and every bell under quarantine is a plank pried from a family’s floor, Aren. You know my crews: they will spit, they will posture, and then they will throw lines to the drowning, because that is what Ferrymen do when the river rises, but do not test the edge too hard. Keep your brass bright and your orderlies in a tight file, and do not block a crane or a gangplank longer than the time it takes to breathe a calm breath or you will trade soft words for hard hands. I will keep my poles sheathed if your people keep their mouths gentle; I will not have a plague-market on my wharves nor a spectacle for factors who count ledgers faster than heartbeats. Tell your bell-ringers this from me: we remember those who throw lines, and we also remember those who tie knots without asking; if this goes smooth, I will say that Aren Siltwarden piloted care like a light boat through a crowded cut. But if someone turns a quarantine into a cudgel against the guild, I will close this bank with my own hands and we will settle our quarrel in the Conclave and the canals both.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aren Siltwarden\", \"lines\": \"I left your guild rather than raise a pole at healers, Sava, and those reeds still stand where I planted them, so believe me when I say I am not here to shame a working crew. I will thread the skiff where tempers thin and not where they thicken, and if any of mine forget that bread is bought by backs and not by bell-ink, I will remind them aloud. Jilai, I will keep the stone dry unless the child needs its song, and if I must wet it, I will count the ripples it makes in faces as well as in water. When I reach the Iron Bank I will trade in patience and plain speech, and I will measure success not by applause but by how few throats go hoarse. And when the skiff is moored, I will carry the pebble and my words to Sila Jor at the Archives, because if the Weir’s voice has a cousin in this glass, someone needs to read the score before the city finds itself dancing to it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sila Jor\", \"lines\": \"Bring the pebble to me sealed and dry, and bring your memory of its song folded carefully, Aren, because sloppy recollection is how we drown in our own wells. The Concordant Archives have cataloged river-sung stones dredged near the Sunken Charterstone before, but most were cracked lullabies, not this sharp note that seems to shepherd a fever like an oar nudging a drifting skiff. I will lower your account on copper wire and I will listen for echoes in related recollections, and if the Weir’s cadence hides inside, we will find which sluice-gate of history it opens. You must not let anyone wet this pebble out of curiosity, not even a kindly orderly; water is a key here, and keys used carelessly find locks we did not mean to open. Expect protest from the Order of the Luminous Weir if I draw a line from their choral gates to this child’s stone, and expect the Temple to bristle if I call their covenant notes cousins to machinery; politics rush faster than spring melt. If you kept peace on the wharves as you claim you aim to, then your report will have a clean surface I can trust, and I will write a note to the bell-tree that says so; reputation is not a ledger entry here, but a thread that keeps us from coming apart.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rana Olt\", \"lines\": \"I hear you bring a skiff through troubled chop, Aren, and I hear talk of a pebble that sings in one of our keys, though we never taught that note to stone. The gates sometimes hum on their own when the river remembers a storm that has not arrived yet, and the untrained call it an omen when really it is a warning bell in mathematics. If any of my chanters stand on the wharf this morning, they will lower their voices and hold their tongues, because the Weir does not need a choir to drown out the sound of people talking to each other. Should you need a calm passage, there is a maintenance cut near the old crane that we can open by hand without singing; it is narrow, and it will make the Ferrymen’s eyebrows climb, but it keeps elbows from throwing words into fists. If your stone’s tone matches one of our missing notes, I will want to hear it in a closed room, and I will want to see your face when it sings, because the river has a way of telling us who is lying by making their jaw ache.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Lead with Bells and Bread\", \"text\": \"You raise the brass token high and ask Jilai’s orderlies to mark time with soft bell-tree patterns, a call-and-response the wharf has learned to trust during flood seasons. You speak first to the stevedores about lost shifts and the way fevers eat wages, naming names of families you know so the abstract becomes a person with a soup pot, and you promise to keep the gangplanks free between breaths. You lay out a small crate of hospice bread at the foot of the skiff with a hand-written note that says paid by the Brass Menders, not by the guild, and you invite Sava’s least senior crew to take it first so pride finds a path to generosity. You station yourself where voices crest and you answer them one by one, not with rebuttal but with reflection, repeating back what you hear until shoulders drop and eyes flick toward the child under the awning instead of the banner on the pole. You keep the pebble dry and the token bright, and you organize the line so that care happens in the eddies of work, not against it, and the morning’s rhythm becomes labor braided with mercy rather than labor battered by it.\", \"outcome\": \"The dockside grumbles migrate into jokes, and jokes migrate into stories about a time the Ferrymen threw lines for a plague-barge, and the skiff is absorbed into that memory rather than made an exception to it. Sava Deren watches, arms across her chest, and when you meet her eye she gives a short nod that says this cost me less than I feared and bought me more than I hoped. The child is carried through with hardly a ripple of protest, and a few of Sava’s younger hands even clear a path without being told, which lets your orderlies pretend they never needed protection at all. No poles are raised, no crates are kicked, and the bread crate comes back light enough to float in your palm; word travels up-canal that Aren Siltwarden can turn a crowd with the same quiet pressure he uses to turn a skiff. The pebble remains dry until you reach the Archives, and when you hand it to Sila Jor, the report you give is so clean she barely needs to lower it on copper wire to find the thread she wants.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Parley with the Guild, Re-route the Care\", \"text\": \"You meet Sava at the edge of her shadow and you speak to her as a working captain, not as a petitioner, and you propose a compromise that keeps the wharf open while the skiff does its work. You ask her to loan you a barge mooring at the low end of the quay so the clinic can touch only river, not dock, and you promise to make the Menders’ line run like a ferry queue, not a blockade. You offer to have Jilai’s bell-keepers ring out a schedule every half-bell so crews can time their offloads, and you draft a simple tally of voucher slips the Menders will honor for sick days, written in your hand so it lands as a promise not a ploy. You walk the length of the crane rails with Sava and you let her show you the pinch-points so you can place your orderlies where they will be least in the way, and you bow your head when she mentions a crewman coughing who will never admit it. You keep the pebble wrapped and you reserve the right to wet it only if the child seizes, and Sava agrees to throw a line to mercy if you throw a line to profits by keeping time holy to work.\", \"outcome\": \"The compromise feels like a well-set keel: it does not make the boat lighter, but it makes the boat true, and most people will take truth over lightness when they have to stand on it. Sava sends a quick hand to chalk the schedule you agreed upon on a post where everyone can see it, and the simple act of naming a rhythm changes the day’s movements from chaos to choreography. There are grumbles about vouchers and who will honor them, but your name on the slip sobers some of the talk, and the Brass Menders’ seal makes it law enough for the morning. The child’s passage across the borrowed mooring is brisk and dignified, and the sight of care happening off the planks keeps arguments from turning into a referendum on sovereignty of the wharf. You arrive at the Archives a bell later than you hoped but without a bruise among your people, and Sila Jor frowns at the delay until she reads the clarity of your plan in the report and admits that timing is sometimes part of the cure.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Invoke a Quiet Cut from the Weir\", \"text\": \"You step aside and send a runner to Gate-Choirmistress Rana Olt, asking for the hand-crank opening of a maintenance cut that bypasses the most congested portion of the Iron Bank. You explain to your orderlies that this route will look like favoritism to some, and you instruct them to wear humility like a cloak and to keep eyes down when passing the rusted iron markers that say Order Only. You signal Sava’s foremen and tell them in plain words that this is a one-time emergency cut for a child’s sake, not a precedent to be held against their tolls or their pride, and you ask for patience, not permission. You keep the pebble wrapped and you assign two rowers to push you through the narrow culvert where the Weir’s breath can be felt in the stone, a heartbeat of the river turned mechanical and then turned human again by your hands. You promise yourself that if any man lays a hand to a pole in anger because of this choice, you will be the first to step into the circle and the last to step out, because duty without courage is just a polite word for fear.\", \"outcome\": \"The maintenance cut opens with a groan like an old song finding its note, and the skiff slides through shadow with only the chafe of rope to mark its passage, a ghost of medicine in a city that prefers its compassion visible. Some Ferrymen curse as you emerge because they read the bypass as an insult, but Sava’s sharp glance stills most of it; she reads the child’s pallor and calculates a cost she can live with. The Order’s presence brushes your shoulders like cold mist, and you find yourself listening for the Weir’s choir in the stone and wondering if the pebble can hear it too through layers of cloth. There is talk afterward that the Weir and the Menders made a secret pact to starve the wharf of dignity, and you spend a few words and a few favors smoothing that rumor to a duller edge in the taverns nearby. At the Archives, Sila Jor notes the route in her mind and in her ledger, and she tells you softly that sometimes saving a life uses up more trust than blood, and that both must be replenished with care.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Take the Veiled Passage\", \"text\": \"On the quay’s edge a masked courier from the Veilhouse of Whispers lets a thread dangle where only your eyes will see it, and you recognize Sorev Dusk’s craft in the knot. You take three patient breaths, then you choose speed over spectacle and agree to guide the skiff along a submerged conduit that runs beneath the Ledgerhall of Tithes, a path used to move cursed coin once and better intentions now. You tell Jilai’s people only what they must know, which is where to place their feet and when to hold their breath, and you steel yourself against the knowledge that every favor owed in shadow casts a longer shadow later. You keep the pebble wrapped and dry, and in the cool, echoing conduit you swear you can hear it hum with a note that is not quite yours, not quite the Weir’s, something like a debt remembering itself. You emerge under an old crane, unseen and unbloodied, and you know you have spared the wharf a quarrel at the cost of a promise you will one day have to balance with interest.\", \"outcome\": \"The skiff glides through the undercity as if the river itself had blinked and re-opened its eyes in a darker room, and when you rise again, the morning on the Iron Bank has not yet had time to sharpen its knives on frustration. No fights spark, no bellies growl at the sight of hospice bread, and no one can say the Menders turned work into a sermon, but the rumor of a secret passage sticks to the day like damp fog. Sava hears it and files it under things that make her watch you harder without making her hate you more; she has used hidden channels herself and she knows a necessary sin when she sees one. The child is carried straight to the Archive’s steps with only river-water on her hair, and Sila Jor accepts the pebble and your report with eyes that weigh more than words, noting the path you chose as much as the peace you kept. Later, a message from the Veilhouse slides under your door like a fish through reeds, and it says only this balance will be called when most inconvenient, which is how balances work, but you sleep that night knowing the wharf kept its temper because your conscience kept its promise.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"currency\", \"description\": \"12 city-coins sealed with the Ledgerhall’s tithe-mark, paid in gratitude for safe escort at dawn.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Brass Menders token of passage (allows safe travel through quarantine lines) engraved with a bell-tree and a reed.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Humming Pebble (sealed for delivery to Archives), its note caged in waxed cloth until Sila Jor opens it.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Brass Menders +2: word spreads that you kept care moving without blood or bile.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Silver Ferrymen +1: grudging respect for threading mercy through a working wharf.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"access\", \"description\": \"Saffron Hospice quarantine lanes: recognized passage during bell-marked closures.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
