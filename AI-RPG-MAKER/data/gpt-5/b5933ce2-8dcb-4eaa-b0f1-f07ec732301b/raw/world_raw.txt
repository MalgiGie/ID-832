"{\n  \"city\": \"Vyratha, the River Crown, rises on a stone island where the twin rivers Tess and Vail clasp together like silver hands. Terraced districts coil around a central basalt knoll crowned by copper-green spires, and a stepped embankment of pale limestone holds back the tidal moods of the joined waters. Bridges as old as history knit the island to four riverbanks, each bank a different province in temperament and trade: the Saffron Bank with its dyehouses and hospices; the Iron Bank with foundries and ship-keels; the Reed Bank with boathouses on stilts and floating gardens; and the Lantern Bank whose night markets burn until dawn.\\n\\nFounded three and a half centuries ago by refugees of the Emberfallow War, Vyratha began as a fortified ferry-town controlling the only safe ford for a hundred miles. The first Charterstone—now sunken downstream—bound river spirits to gentle the current around the island, a pact that made Vyratha both possible and perilous: prosperity flowed with the rivers, but so did rivals and hungry gods. Through the era of Flood-Princes and the later Quiet Regency, Vyratha grew into a city-state whose coin is trusted, whose archives are coveted, and whose weirs tame a capricious waterway with artifice and prayer.\\n\\nPower is shared uneasily. The River Crown Citadel hosts a Rotating Conclave of guildmasters, clergy of the Nine Tides, and civic stewards chosen by lottery from landed households. The Order of the Luminous Weir commands water-magic and engineering that keep the city from drowning; the Indigosatchel Consortium moves grain, dye, and letters; the Guild of Silver Ferrymen holds the docks and pilots the shoals; the Brass Menders salve the poor and the wounded; and within the alleys, the Night Ledger tallies debts no sun has seen. Alliances shift with the river’s depth. Festivals—like the Lantern Unmooring, when thousands of wick-boats drift to mark the river spirits’ pact—momentarily still the knives.\\n\\nLegends braid through the streets: that the basalt knoll is the brow of a drowned titan; that the Moonbridge reappears on nights of thirteenth moonlight; that a third river runs beneath Vyratha, a current of memory accessible through the Concordant Archives. Skeptics scoff, then hire guides.\\n\\nVyratha’s lifeblood is trade. Grain ships from the upland terraces, iron blooms from hill forges, saffron-dyed cloth from the delta farms, and star-fruit from the Starfall Orchard all pass through Prism Market. In return, Vyratha exports precision locks, river-keels, sealed ledgers, and skilled hands. The city depends on the Luminous Weir to hold spring floods in check and on treaties with the Reedbound marsh clans for safe passage through the Gilded Marsh. It also depends—quietly—on the Night Ledger to keep criminal feuds short and survivable.\\n\\nConflicts simmer. The Indigosatchel Consortium seeks to privatize sections of the river wall, alarming the Temple of the Nine Tides. The Ferrymen and Weir Order feud over canal tolls and sluice schedules. The Reedbound resent new taxes on barge-gardens. Farther out, dwarven syndic from the Seven-Kettle Springs threaten to embargo coal unless the city ceases its star-metal prospecting in the Obsidian Fault. And always there is the river’s own temper: twice in living memory, the pact wavered and the lower terraces drowned.\\n\\nRecent whispers tell of pitted, glassy stones dredged near the Sunken Charterstone that sing when wet. The Brass Menders report night fevers in the Saffron Bank. And at low tide, some claim to hear choral notes rising from the gaps in the weir—like a choir buried in the riverbed seeking breath.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Gilded Reed Marsh\",\n      \"type\": \"wetland\",\n      \"description\": \"A sprawling amber marsh downstream of Vyratha where reeds gleam with a natural sheen and floating gardens rise and fall with the tide.
