Artisans chanted their work-canticles in steady measure as Brina Coil stepped from the glow, ink-scarred hands folded and eyes bright as furnace-stars. She spoke of the Obsidian Fault, that noon-dark stair of glass where trapped starlight shivered in the stone and an unseen hymn pulsed beneath the plates like breath under ribs. The survey would be neutral as a scale and careful as a midwife, she said, for the lattice was no ore seam to gouge but a sealed song whose notes held tides and tempers in balance. Seven-Kettle’s envoy, Thorek Brimvauld, waited with the patience of rock yet with a frown like a chisel’s edge, and behind his beard lay a thousand hammer-songs and a ledger of old grievances. Temple augurs would walk beside Emberlight journeymen, memory pins gleaming like brass thorns and a prism register ready to catch the lattice’s pulse without nicking the skin of the world. Rumors, thin as wire and twice as dangerous, hinted that Indigosatchel’s smiling factors carried a private clause in a hidden fold, a purchase-order written against the city’s soul and payable in star-metal. Aren Siltwarden’s task was simple in words and perilous in water: carry the party to the rift, hold every hand from trespass, bind every tongue to truth, and bring back a map of a song without weeping a single note from stone.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Emberlight Artificers and Temple augurs to the Obsidian Fault and keep the party neutral under competing claims.\",\n        \"Negotiate safe passage and observation terms with Thorek Brimvauld representing Seven-Kettle.\",\n        \"Use the prism register and memory pin to map the lattice’s pulse without damaging it.\",\n        \"Expose or document any illegal star-metal clauses in Indigosatchel contracts encountered on-site.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Brina Coil\", \"lines\": \"We bind fire to purpose and we have sworn our forges will not be coaxed to make blades that thirst for nothing but blood. The city needs bearings that do not seize and sluices that sing true, not some greedy hole torn in a hymn that steadies the river’s breathing. Walk with us at the Fault and keep tempers from running like molten glass, because a single careless word can ripple the lattice and crack more than stone. If we can prove to all eyes that the lattice is a song and not a seam, even the coin-counters may listen when silence is dearer than metal. I will place a prism register in your hands and a memory pin at your heart, and I ask you to be the hinge that does not grind when pressure comes. Should shadowed clauses arrive wrapped in smiles, we will not sign what we cannot sing to our apprentices with clean throats.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Thorek Brimvauld\", \"lines\": \"Our kettles sing true because we listen to stone when it is quiet and when it is storming, not because we bully it with picks and writs. I do not trust your Ledgerfolk nor your market queens, for I have seen obligations turned into garrotes, but I have watched an oath-bound man stand fast in flood and keep a bridge from breaking. Draw me proof and swear me witness that your city will not steal star-metal from under our noses while preaching restraint, and I will see your forges have salt and iron through winter without a single wagon delayed. These ledges are our grandparents’ bones as much as they are your city’s lifeline, so no chips pocketed, no shards palmed, and no notes hummed that you do not admit. The lattice wakes when you lie to it, and when stone wakes angry it does not go back to sleep for a dozen winters. Keep your words square, your boots sure, and your fellows watched, and I will keep my crews’ tempers banked like coals under ash.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mereth Tydel\", \"lines\": \"The Temple teaches that some flows are covenant and some are trespass, and the lattice beneath the Fault has the feel of covenant bound in the world’s first ink. Walk calmly, keep your breath measured, and let the augurs’ bells set the pace so that our presence is a courtesy and not a raid. If a note rises beneath your feet that you do not know, do not follow it with your voice, for echo is a hunger as surely as any appetite. We bless this survey for observation and remembrance, not extraction, and an oath will be spoken that any gleaned profit shall be shared in health and safety, not weaponized for rivalry. Aren Siltwarden, I witnessed your oath once when your name was a thread in my hands, and I ask you to hold the memory of that river-quiet now against all clever bargains. Bring back truth like clear water in a basin, and we will pour it for all to see without salt of shame.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Quill Vess\", \"lines\": \"I care little for the vanity of coin, and less for the pride of those who count it, but I care for the Weir whose song must remain steady or the city learns to tread water in its sleep. The lattice under the Fault hums on a frequency our gates answer to in their dreams, and a wrong chord there would make our sluices stutter like a heart with skipped beats. I have sent chant-figures and hydrographs, and I will lend you an apprentice who hears stone as if it were rain, but you must keep them from any dispute that would set their throat to shouting. Do not allow the survey to become spectacle, nor the ledge to become a court, because both draw crowds and crowds draw tragedy. Return with a map of pulses and intervals, and we will write a counter-hymn of respect rather than an anthem of conquest.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aren Siltwarden\", \"lines\": \"I have read oaths in the white of eyes and in the black of ink, and I know which ones drown you and which ones keep you afloat until morning. We will map, and we will not mine, and if any hand reaches to pry a singing stone I will set my pole between that hand and the hymn until my arms shake and my jaw scars ache. Thorek, Brina, Mereth, and even you, Quill, hold me to my word and I will hold the city to yours as if I were a knot in a ferry-rope during spring surge. I am Reedbound and I have learned that current takes the shape of its banks, so let me be a good bank today and keep this water honest. If rumors scuttle on little legs and offer easy profit, I will pin them to the board with daylight and names. Walk with me, speak plain, and we will come home with our boots wet and our honor dry.\"\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Keep the survey scrupulously neutral\", \"text\": \"You set strict ledge rules before a single boot leaves the rope ladder, and you repeat them until even the wind seems to nod. No samples are taken, no chants are raised beyond the augurs’ soft measures, and all notes are recorded in duplicate with both Temple and Seven-Kettle seals warmed and pressed. When an Indigosatchel courier drifts close with a smile like polished glass and offers a sealed addendum to expedite jointly beneficial outcomes, you refuse it in the open where all can hear. You insist the prism register remain on a tripod in plain view and that the memory pin’s chain wrap your wrist where any slight of hand would be impossible. By day’s end the lattice’s pulse is captured in clean intervals, the ledge has seen no scuffle, and even the echo-maddened bats quiet as if soothed by your consistency.\", \"outcome\": \"Seven-Kettle crews nod to you with the respect given to a pilot who steers straight in fog, and Thorek marks your name in a small book that is not for debts but for winter favors. Brina’s apprentices return with shoulders loose and eyes alight, and her thanks comes like a warm bell struck once and true. Indigosatchel factors look away as if the sun were in their faces, and you can feel the hum of a rumor shifting to find a less stubborn host. The Temple’s augurs draft a joint remit that affirms observation rights without extraction, and the Conclave clerks quietly request copies of your clean maps. You earn no new enemies on the ledge that day, but you do collect a few watchful glances that promise future tests of your resolve.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Broker a stone-song pact on the ledge\", \"text\": \"Sensing a rare alignment of tempered wills, you call for a pause and invite Thorek, Brina, and the senior augur to stand at the tripod while the prism register stills. You speak of songs shared across banks, of forges and sluices and shrines all balanced on the same thin lumen of the world, and you propose a formal pact to treat the lattice as a sacred instrument held in common rather than a resource to be divided. You request that Seven-Kettle provide a listening rota, the Temple a rite of seasonal courtesy, and Emberlight a published ledger of any calculations derived so that no silence hides theft. Your words are plain but threaded with the marsh’s patience, and you lay a reed-charm on the tripod as a token that humble things can bind great waters if all agree to be bound. One by one, they answer with the weight of their offices rather than the heat of their prides, and the bats in the rift turn circles like ink-drawn signatures.\", \"outcome\": \"A provisional pact is inked on the back of a coal manifest and sealed with augur wax that smells faintly of rain, and the ledge feels different, as if tension were a rope finally made taut instead of frayed. Thorek promises a season’s grace on iron tariffs to the Cloister, Brina agrees to publish nonlethal findings in the Archives, and Mereth stakes Temple authority to guard the pact as a covenant rather than a contract. The Weir Order, hearing of it, sends a clipped note that commends intent but warns of jurisdictional tangles, and you can feel Quill’s cool gaze measuring the pact’s harmonics. A star-sired wraith stirs at dusk, curious rather than cruel, and the augurs hum it back to sleep with a line from the new pact, proving the lattice answers to respect. The pact’s fame travels faster than barges, and while it births new arguments in council halls, it also births a fragile circle of trust on the ledge that your name quietly anchors.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Expose the shadow clause before all witnesses\", \"text\": \"When the Indigosatchel courier tries again, you ask to read the addendum under the excuse of framing it against the sun for clarity, and in that brief tilt the sea-night auras hidden in your Moonshard charm show you text that should not exist. The clause binds the signers to accept emergency extraction of star-metal if a defined anomaly is detected, with the anomaly described so broadly that any shiver of wind could qualify. You breathe once to steady your pulse, call for silence, and ask the courier to read the clause aloud to the ledge, and when they refuse you use the prism register to cast the script onto the rock. Words sharpen like fish-bones of light, and the augurs gasp while Thorek’s jaw sets as hard as cooled slag. You keep your tone even and invite the courier to explain how trust is to be built on a plank with rot hidden in the grain.\", \"outcome\": \"Calra Orun is not present, but her shadow arrives in the form of three offended seals and a promise that this was a draft never meant for use, and yet even drafts reveal the hand that holds the pen. The Temple declares the clause sacrilege on its face, Seven-Kettle calls it an insult antiqued in fresh ink, and Emberlight stamps the addendum void and files the projection in the Concordant Archives before night. Indigosatchel factors retreat with guarded smiles and sharper eyes, and you can feel the ledgers rearranging themselves to pay you back in some future coin you will not like. The Conclave opens a quiet inquiry that will take too long but not forever, and in the meantime a whisper spreads that Aren Siltwarden reads contracts as well as currents. You leave the ledge with more allies than you climbed with, and also with the sense that some door elsewhere has closed without a sound.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M5\"], \"next\": [\"M7\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"currency\", \"description\": \"25 coin stipend for escort and negotiation at the Fault.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Obsidian Bearing Kit (improves mobility on slick stone).\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Syndic’s Iron Chit (trade goodwill at Seven-Kettle stalls).\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Emberlight Artificers +3.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Seven-Kettle Syndic +2.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Temple of the Nine Tides +1.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"access\", \"description\": \"Supervised access to the Obsidian Fault observation ledges.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
