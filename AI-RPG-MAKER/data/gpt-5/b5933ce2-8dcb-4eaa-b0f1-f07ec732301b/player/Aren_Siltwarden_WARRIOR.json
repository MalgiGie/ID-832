        "description": "Broad-shouldered and river-lean, bronze skin weathered by marsh sun, black hair braided with reed-cords and copper charms. Wears lacquered tide-mail over marsh leathers, with a cloak cut for movement aboard skiffs.",

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Born on a drift-isle in the Gilded Reed Marsh, Aren Siltwarden learned to read current and sky before he could read script. As a teen pilot he ferried hospice boats through fog corridors, then signed on with the Guild of Silver Ferrymen as convoy guard during tax protests. A riot at the Luminous Weir left him cut by a slackening chain; he dragged two chanters from a failing song-gate and earned a cool nod of thanks from the Order—along with a lifelong distrust of any machine that demands hymns to behave. When Indigosatchel factors pushed to fence off a stretch of river wall, Aren refused a job to break the Brass Menders’ picket and walked away from guild pay rather than swing a pole at healers. The Night Ledger’s Veilhouse noticed a principled brawler; Maskwright Sorev Dusk offered a mask and a ledger-cleaning in exchange for one collection in the Hollowwind Barrows. Aren took the mask, went to the Barrows, and instead of extracting a widow’s oath-tooth he burned the debt-thread and walked her home under his cloak. That choice put him on quiet notice with the Ledger and cost him his guild berth. Seeking cover, he pledged a river-oath before High Acolyte Mereth Tydel to keep violence from drowning trade, and for a season worked Temple escort on processional barges. During a fever surge from the Saffron Bank, he carried a delirious child across a thirteenth-moon span—paying the Moonbridge’s toll with his own true name so the bridge would take them where the Brass Menders could save her. For a year and a day, friends forgot him; Mereth kept memory by ritual thread and spoke him a new river-name back into the city. Since then Aren has made a living as a neutral blade in Vyratha’s disputes—bodyguard for marsh delegates, escort for archive processions, and the rare fist at a negotiation table. Prime Factor Calra Orun has tried to hire him twice to lean on Starfall Orchard keepers; both times he declined. Whispers now tie Aren to stolen prism-ware, to Weir spillway maps he refuses to sell, and to a single glowing tile pried from the Sunken Charterstone that he returned at night without asking leave. He claims no banner, but the Reedbound call him when canals clog with politics, and even the Ledger has learned that when Aren says a fight ends at the water’s edge, it ends.",

He also paid the Moonbridge toll with his true name to save a fevered child; for a year no one remembered him but Mereth Tydel, and though his life was spoken back into the city, the river still holds his first name and whispers it when he sleeps."
