As a child she discovered she could anticipate the lulls of the Syrinx Wind Courts with uncanny precision; wind-scribes called her a natural lull-reader. Apprenticed briefly to a Ledger ribbon-clerk, she was tasked with timing testimony against the harps, but she balked when asked to steer breath into a sealed subchamber rumored to distill ‘truth-water.’ Leaving the Counting-House, she volunteered with the Cliffward Compact as a lift runner, carrying Solace oils to the Cascadrome frames. There she met Arch-Condensor Meret Hal, who noticed Tallea’s knack for hearing harmonic fatigue in metal and stone. Meret arranged for her to study echo-stone at the quarries, where Tallea learned to draw out faint memory-chords from calcite seams. A dusk vigil with the Veil Covenant at the rim revealed the mists answered her in phrases—snatches of lost bargains, lullabies, and warning hums that matched the Heliolith’s noon-song. With Maela Vint, a daring Mistral pilot, Tallea glided to the Tangle-Root Archive to test a theory: that the Heliolith’s dimming is a missing note, not a spent flame. The grove fed her a night-flower that taught her to ‘splice’ a chord by braiding wind, water, and heat. She returned to Aurelia determined to reconcile engineering with rite. Her research put her at odds with Kael Orisborn, a stepwell warden with a lineage tied to the first steward; he pressed austerity and distrusted any rite that could unbalance ration law. When bypass valves at the Cascadrome were exposed during a drought, Tallea refused Ledger coin to keep silent and instead demonstrated a resonant test that made hidden lines sing. Since then she works as an itinerant resonance-mage: translating fog-echoes for grieving families at Remembrance Drift, tuning lift chains before festival loads, and mapping safe wind windows for sky-sails. She believes the Skybridge Ossuary still remembers the unsanctioned chord that unmoored Ilys the Lintel—and that the Heliolith’s inner prism can be retuned if the city agrees on a shared note.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Resonant Calcite Fork\",\n      \"description\": \"A tuning fork cut from Echo Quarry stone; when struck, it reveals hairline fractures and hidden valve hums by sympathetic vibration.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Fog-Silk Ribbon Kite\",\n      \"description\": \"A collapsible, palm-wide ribbon-kite inscribed with knot-notations to catch and replay wind-lulls for later study.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shard-Lenticle\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm lens ground from a legal Heliolith offcut, edged in copper ligature; clarifies heat-shimmers and helps parse the Spire’s noon-codes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Blue-Timer Token Set\",\n      \"description\": \"Three hourglass tokens in graduated sands, stamped by the Aquifer Collegium; Tallea carries them as ration, payment, and social signal.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Solace Enzyme Kit\",\n      \"description\": \"Vials of anti-salt oils, absorbent moss pads, and a wick-brush used to quiet condenser squeal and protect metal from mist corrosion.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wind-Scribe Ribbon Case\",\n      \"description\": \"Spools of bark-ribbon and glowcap ink pens; used to draft wind-maps and court statements timed between harp notes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Night-Flower Seed Pod\",\n      \"description\": \"A Tangle-Root pod that glows when a truth is spoken nearby; cracked carefully it releases a dream-lesson once.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Compact Chain-Pass\",\n      \"description\": \"A brass token with the Cliffward Compact’s seal, granting emergency access to lift control rooms during rescue or maintenance calls.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 8,\n    \"agility\": 12,\n    \"constitution\": 11,\n    \"intelligence\": 17,\n    \"wisdom\": 15,\n    \"charisma\": 14,\n    \"dexterity\": 13,\n    \"endurance\": 11,\n    \"perception\": 16,\n    \"luck\": 10\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Mediation\",\n    \"Ritual timing\",\n    \"Mnemonic cartography\",\n    \"Wind-court oratory\",\n    \"Conflict de-escalation\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Maela Vint\": \"Mistral Syndic line-binder and glide pilot who ferried Tallea to the Tangle-Root Archive and the Skybridge Ossuary on off-book dusk runs; confidant and occasional lover, though their bond strains when Syndic strikes threaten safety nets Tallea supports.\",\n    \"Kael Orisborn\": \"Stepwell warden descended from the Oris line; once a study partner in condenser maintenance murals, now a principled rival pushing strict ration austerity.
