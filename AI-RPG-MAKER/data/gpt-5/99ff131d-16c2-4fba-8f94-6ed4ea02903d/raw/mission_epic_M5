"{\n  \"missions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"M5\",\n      \"title\": \"Bones of the Bridge\",\n      \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Maela Vint\", \"affiliation\": \"Mistral Syndic\"},\n      \"description\": \"The Skybridge Ossuary unfurls like a bleached leviathan across the chasm, each vertebra hollow with wind and lined in memory-stone that glows like teeth when the sun is thin. Chimes flutter and bicker in the niches where keepers once paced, and the whole arch breathes—an old creature whose ribs rise on the heat and sink with dusk. Somewhere along its eastward ribline a vertebra remembers you, Tallea Miranth, because you loosened it once with a curious note and the bridge shuddered like it had almost recalled how to fly. Maela Vint angles her kite and marks that same bone with a streamer, the ribbon snaring a friendly current and pointing the way toward a seam full of acoustic ghosts. The last keepmaster’s unsanctioned chord is rumored to sleep there, not as a full song but as a shard of feeling the stone cannot shake: a note of boldness too certain for safety, a note of parting too clean for grief. To pry out a piece is to test old bindings, yet if you can coax a sliver free without waking the whole spine to its death-remembering, you may carry home a sibling-note the Heliolith might accept and hum beside in peace.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Reach the marked vertebra across a cross-shear window with Maela’s guidance, timing your glide between the harps of wind that guard the span.\",\n        \"Harvest a shard of memory-stone that holds the ‘unsanctioned chord’ without causing a collapse or triggering a harmonic slide in the vertebra.\",\n        \"Drive off a chime-flock attracted to gleam and vibration before they peck tools and tear kitecloth in a frenzy.\",\n        \"Consult bridge-keeper Osk Talin on stabilizing the extracted shard for transport so the memory does not smear or sour.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Maela Vint\", \"lines\": \"I can smell the cross-shears before the banners even twitch, and that makes my laugh come out clipped, because fear is just love with sharper edges. I know what you did here last season, and I know you did it for a note that wouldn’t let you sleep, but bones are for holding lives first and songs second, and you forgot that when you pried at the seam. We’ll go back with contrition and with skill, and we will thread the lulls like needlework, because this bridge punishes arrogance with gusts that feel like judgment. When the chimes mob us, I will be the loudest thing in the sky, and I will flash every mirror and rattle every bell so their fury folds toward me and away from your hands. You will keep your cuts shallow and your breath even, and you will leave a ribbon to carry the strain we borrow, because borrowed strain must be paid back. Bring me home to Selen Gate with your pockets unbroken and your eyes still listening, and I will forgive you for not asking me last time, because forgiveness is a rope we both pull. And if the bridge mutters that we are not worthy of its memory, we will answer with humility and try again on a calmer day, because living to try again is better than being right only once.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tallea Miranth\", \"lines\": \"I was a fool in love with a missing note, and I treated this spine like a riddle instead of a reliquary, and I am sorry. This time I will not sing first; I will listen until the seam offers its own thread, and I will follow it only as far as it is willing to be followed. I will cut no deeper than kindness allows, and I will bed the cut with ribbon and wax so the bruise does not spread, because I know now that sound can bleed. If the shard wants to be carried it will lighten in my palm, and if it wants to stay, I will leave it and mark the place and thank it for the lesson. I will not steal from the dead to decorate the living; I will ask the dead to teach the living how to survive. And when we cross back through the shears, I will keep my fear inside the count, because fear can be counted like beats, and counted fear cannot surprise the hands.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Osk Talin\", \"lines\": \"Memory-stone is an elder who has sat through too many councils, and it lies out of habit when struck too hard, just to see if you’ll catch it. Bring me the shard and I’ll breathe on it through linen so it remembers warmth more than shock, then I’ll flood its pores with boneglue that cures slow and honest because haste insults old stories. We’ll wrap it in a listening cloth stitched with dull thread, not bright, so the chime-flock won’t peck at it just for pride, and I’ll etch a counter-hum along the edge so the loudest parts don’t grind themselves flat on the walk back. Don’t tap it on the way home, not even once, not even to show a friend, because the last keepmaster’s pride sits close to the surface, and it will seize your finger like an oath and drag you into its version of the truth. If the shard starts to sweat a little hum, let it; that means it’s shedding heat and not trying to wake, and I’ll lay it under calcite dust at my bench so it sleeps like proper stone. And when the Spire listens, make sure it is at noon when the city breathes together, because midnight light makes memories sharpen to needles, and needles make people bleed words they can’t heal from.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nyra Kest\", \"lines\": \"Training winds have been mean, slicing the field like old debts, and the harps have a pitch I don’t like, the kind that shears a wing if your mind wanders. If you can bring back a kinder note for the Spire to hum beside, one that smooths the gusts at the Selen Gate by a breath or two, we’ll lose fewer sails to songs that cut. But don’t you die for a chord, lull-reader, because I can hire a dozen couriers and not one will be you with your ear and your patience and your blue-stained fingers. We can always write new music for our lines and nets, but we can’t write a new you, and we can’t stitch you back from the fog if it decides to keep you. Fly smart, leave show-off work to rookies hungry for claps, and if the chimes see you, blind them with dullness and humility, because chimes hate being ignored more than they hate being out-sung.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Sing the Binding Lull beside the seam\", \"text\": \"You kneel at the marked vertebra and press your palm to the cool vein where glass-sand meets bone, timing your breath to the bridge’s rise and fall. Instead of prying at once, you hum the old lull that the Veil Covenant taught you, a thread meant to bind frayed timbers and calm rattling chains. You choose notes that make space rather than demand surrender, and you keep your tones below the harps so the wind writes you into its margins instead of its headline. The chime-flock edges closer at the first vibration, offended by any melody not their own, but you let Maela’s mirrors clatter and pull their anger wide while you fold your sound inward. The seam answers like a muscle unclenching in sleep, and a hairline crack shows itself not with a snap but with a sigh that tastes of rain in quarry air. You feel the shard loosen, a sliver that carries the memory of a bold step and a held breath, and you know that if you push harder the whole rib will remember more than it can bear.\", \"outcome\": \"The lull knits the surrounding stress while easing the shard free, and the vertebra settles with a grateful creak rather than a resentful lurch. The chimes harry Maela with pecks and petty bravery, but she curses like a saint and lures them along a safe cross-shear until they spend their fury and scatter. In your hands the shard is warm as if it has argued itself hoarse, and the hum that leaks from it is rounded, not razor-edged, which bodes well for the Heliolith’s temper. Osk Talin praises your restraint and coats the piece with slow-curing boneglue, sealing in the kinder contour while warning that the song’s edge will test anyone who listens with arrogance. Word of your method reaches the Veil Covenant and the Compact both: the Covenant nods that you honored breath with gentleness, and the Compact notes that the bridge did not shed a single scale. When you leave, the bones behind you do not grumble, and the wind at Selen Gate feels one measure softer, enough that Nyra’s trainees make their afternoon turns without a single tear in their practice sails.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Cut with Engineer’s Precision and the Calcite Fork\", \"text\": \"You ignore the temptation to sing and instead strike your resonant calcite fork against a rib of quiet stone, mapping the vertebra’s hairline tensions by the way your palm vibrates. You pace the beats between the aeolian harp sighs and move when the notes dip, anchoring a fog-silk ribbon in three places to distribute the load like a patient surgeon. Your shard-lenticle brings heat-shimmer into crisp lines, and you see where the unsanctioned chord pooled and cooled, a darker grain just below the skin. You wedge a sliver knife not at the obvious seam but at the counter-seam you found with your fork, because old lies sit where everyone can see them and old truths hide off to the side. The cut is slow because you stop whenever the bridge groans, counting five steady breaths before you press again, letting Maela’s moving shadow keep the chimes interested in everything but your hands. When the shard lifts at last, the gap you leave behind is narrow and banded in ribbon, and the vertebra’s voice rises a half-note then settles back down, like a throat clearing politely.\", \"outcome\": \"The extraction is clean and almost bloodless in the language of stone, and not a single vertebra in the chain slides to complain about your courtesy. The shard’s memory is crisp, edges sharp as a drafting blade, and Osk warns you that such clarity can cut whomever listens without proper callus, so he etches a counter-hum across its back to dull the first bite. Maela grins that particular grin of pilots who have seen a tight landing and respect it more than applause, and she binds your tools to your belt with an extra twist so nothing drops on the hike out. The Mistral Syndic hears you chose the mechanical path under pressure, and a few line-binders whisper that perhaps the Aquifer Collegium’s students have something to teach the kites after all. The Ledger of Fine Weights, hearing a rumor that you can make precision extractions to order, sends a polite inquiry you pointedly ignore, earning a quiet scowl you will feel later in the Wind Courts. Back in the city, the shard speaks in neat measures at noon beside the Spire, and the Heliolith’s hum wavers as if cocking its ear, not displeased by your tidy boldness.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bait the Chime-Flock with a Dull Gleam and Decoy Chant\", \"text\": \"You know the chimes will come for shine and for noise, so you pack your tools in cloth and scrub every polished edge with ash until nothing gleams but the whites of your eyes. You unspool a spare ribbon-kite and knot it with dull bells, setting it to circle on a low line where the cross-shear will play it like a lazy drum, and you mouth a nonsense chant that sounds like coin-counting—music without music. Maela takes the high line and flashes her mirrors only once to draw the first rush, then tucks them and becomes as boring as a ledger, much to the chimes’ fury. The flock mob the decoy, pecking the dull bells as if offended by their lack of brilliance, and you ease toward the seam in their blind spot with the patience of a stepwell warden measuring drought. You work by touch more than by sight, letting your fingertips feel the difference between humble stone and prideful memory, and you pry only when the harps dip and the chimes are busy berating the decoy. The bridge mutters, but not about you, because you have made yourself forgettable, and forgettable hands get work done while everyone else is arguing.\", \"outcome\": \"The decoy suffers a noble death, bells shredded and ribbon gnawed to threads, but it earns you minutes of quiet hands and unmolested tools, which is a fortune on a living bridge. Your shard comes free with a reluctant pop and a wash of emotion that tastes like the moment before a leap, and you catch it in listening cloth before the feeling can stain the rib around it. Osk clucks at the frayed decoy and nods at your tactical humility, packing the shard with extra dull-wax so it travels without advertising itself to any jealous wind. Maela counts the peck-marks in her skin and calls them tuition, then makes you promise to let the Compact’s safety nets be expanded at Selen Gate because she has seen how quickly a simple flock becomes a storm. The Covenant hears that you used a chant with no heart on purpose, a silence shaped like a shield, and they approve of your refusal to bait the dead with pretty lies. When the shard hums near the Heliolith, its tone is a quiet invitation rather than a challenge, and the Spire’s light does not flare or dim but steadies, the way a friend steadies a ladder you are not quite brave enough to climb alone.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M4\"], \"next\": [\"M6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Experience\", \"description\": \"550\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Memory-Stone Shard (Unsanctioned Chord, fragile)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Mistral Syndic: +10\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Voucher\", \"description\": \"Safety Net Voucher from the Cliffward Compact (reduces fall risk once)\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
