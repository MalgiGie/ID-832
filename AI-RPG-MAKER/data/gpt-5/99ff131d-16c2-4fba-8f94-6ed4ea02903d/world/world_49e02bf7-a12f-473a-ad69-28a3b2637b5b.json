    "city": "Aurelia-on-the-Scarp crowns a sun-baked mesa whose sheer amber cliffs overlook the Luminant Vale, a perpetual sea of silver-blue fog that rises with dawn and sinks at dusk. The city grew in concentric crescents along the scarp’s rim, each ring terraced with wind-caught banners, chain-lift platforms, and water-garden steps fed by condensing towers. At the heart stands the Heliolith, a meteoric crystal spire that hums faintly at noon and bleeds pale light at midnight; its fall, three centuries ago, fused sand into glass-veins that guide heat and memory through the bedrock. Early cliff herders and rope-sling fishers followed the glow to safety atop the mesa after dust-choked wars on the plains. They bartered windwork, resilient grains, and fog-silk with caravaners daring the Sable Road below, while learning to wring drinkable water from the breath of the Vale. Today Aurelia thrives as a hinge between sky and earth: sky-sails dock at her suspension piers, caravans spiral up carved switchbacks, and cliffward elevators creak day and night.\nAurelia’s society is braided around three necessities: water, wind, and heat. The Aquifer Collegium governs condensers and stepwells, rationing the Blue-Timers who climb to fill their hourglass tokens. The Mistral Syndic trains rope-wing pilots and moors sky kites at the Selen Gate, taxing every sail that rides the valley thermals. The Ember Ash Cohort keeps the triple forges alive on a steady feed of fossil ash mined from old caldera beds, while the Solace Guild distills fog-silk enzymes and sun-herbs into balms and tinctures coveted across the scarplands. The Ledger of Fine Weights, a counting-house guild, underwrites caravans and quietly owns much of the cliffside warehousing. Shadowing all is the Veil Covenant, a devotional society that sings to the Vale at dusk, claiming the fog thinks and remembers.\nGovernment nominally lies with the Cliff Ministry, a rotating council of stewards selected by district lotteries weighted by water labor. In practice, factions bargain in the Wind Courts, a civic forum tuned with aeolian harps; to be heard, one must speak in lulls between the harps’ tones. Disputes include water-credit speculation vs equitable rationing, skyport mooring rights, risks of alchemical effluent seeping down the scarp, and whether to sanction the Covenant’s fog rites. Dependencies bind Aurelia to her surroundings: ash caravans must pass through bandit-haunted glass flats; skybridges remain half-ruined; condensers rust in salt winds without Solace oils; and the Heliolith’s slow dimming at midsummer has spurred rumors that its heart was plundered. Festivals punctuate life: the Chain Lighting, when the lifts blaze with meteoric sparks; the Blue Hour, a week of free condensation following the first monsoon; and Remembrance Drift, when offerings are cast upon the fog to seek counsel from those lost to the Vale. Legends insist that a sister city, Ilys the Lintel, once spanned a skybridge here and vanished in one night, leaving only a whisper-thread of wind through broken arches. Whether Ilys fell, flew, or dissolved into the fog is a debate as old as the Heliolith’s song.",
