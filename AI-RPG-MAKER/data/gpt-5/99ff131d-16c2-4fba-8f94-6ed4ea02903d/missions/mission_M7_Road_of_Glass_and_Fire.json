    "description": "The Sable Road hums at noon and cracks at night, a black ribbon stretched over old wounds. Captain of Ashes Varo Pell needs a convoy shepherded through mirage-haunted heat to keep the Ternary Crucible fed. More than fuel rides the wagons: copper ligatures essential to binding a prism await pickup at a way-station known only to Ledger couriers. Bandits ride haze like they were born from it, and the road itself seeks excuses to shatter under stress. If you can bring ash and ligature home together, the city gains both breath and a chance to touch the Spire’s hidden heart.",

        "Escort the Ember Ash Cohort convoy through two shatter-line zones.",

If the road cracks under moon-close, we push the wagons over the seams and pray the axle bolts remember their vows. Bandits have a buyer for copper this season, and I’d bet my last spark it’s a Counting-House with clean fingernails. Ride with us. When the noise gets stupid, make it smart with that little fork of yours.\"",

If the Ledger thinks it can tax a necessity into a luxury, I’ll bring back a song the Courts can hum while they cut their bill in half.\"",
