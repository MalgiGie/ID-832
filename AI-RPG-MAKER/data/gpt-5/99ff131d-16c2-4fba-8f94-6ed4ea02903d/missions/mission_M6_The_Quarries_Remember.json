    "description": "Where the Echo Quarries open their throats, the city’s founders still argue about price in voices trapped by stone. Osk Talin, a keeper of resonant seams, asks you to descend into a blue-lit cistern where calcite grew around the first bargain struck with the fallen star. The legend says the Heliolith agreed to share its light if the city shared its water, a parity that ration law later interpreted and hardened. Harmonics here spiral, and one wrong shout collapses a decade of safety into a minute of dust. Pull the founders’ promise from the stone without letting the chamber answer with its own kind of law: cave-in.",

It also knows how to punish anyone who tries to edit one. You take too much, it takes back the ceiling. You sing too loud, it sings your epitaph. Fetch me a block that remembers the words before they were turned into edicts, and I’ll teach you how to make the Fork tell the truth even when you don’t want to hear it.\"",

If the founders bartered light for shared water, then every bypass valve is an offense, and every zealot who seals a spout to teach a lesson is, too. I don’t want a weapon. I want proof strong enough to make both thieves and martyrs blush.\"",
