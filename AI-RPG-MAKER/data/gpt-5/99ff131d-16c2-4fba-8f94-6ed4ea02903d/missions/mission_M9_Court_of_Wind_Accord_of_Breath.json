    "description": "The Syrinx Wind Courts fill with people who have learned to speak between notes. Rhyss Quell asks you to time an accord: Aquifer, Covenant, Mistral, Solace, Compact—and the Ledger, which will attend whether invited or not. The founders’ bargain block sits in a sling, oiled against drying cracks; the memory-stone shard peers from its listening cloth like a guilty eye; the Oris bowl-shard gleams, promising to cut the palms of liars who swear over it. You must pace the accord like breathwork, catching each faction on a lull that suits the truth they can bear. If you succeed, the Courts will authorize a joint operation inside the Heliolith for the first time in living memory.",
    "objectives": [
        "Present the Founders’ Bargain and the Unsanctioned Chord as evidence during timed testimony.",
        "Expose Ledger procedural tricks using your Wind-Scribe Ribbon Case.",
        "Secure a signed joint writ granting access to the Heliolith’s sealed prism chamber.",
        "Ensure safety clauses for Compact crews and sky-lane windows for Mistral support."

You lead them. Make Meret admit the frames can’t fix a note that isn’t metal. Make Ayo promise her runoff won’t slick the stairs to a funeral. Make Thren feel seen so he doesn’t pull a bell just to remind folks he can. Make Far-Kite Serev swallow his strike song for one more evening. And make Avar admit the Ledger doesn’t own the future just because it can subtract it from the present.\"",
        "hero_reply": "Tallea flexes her hands like a pilot testing grip. \"I’ll pace them and give each their preferred wind. I’ll let the founders speak first through stone, then the bridge through bone, then Oris through a shard that bites. If anyone tries to shift the rhythm, I’ll sing the missing beat until they hear it underground. When the writ is ready, I want the clause that binds us to report back in public, not behind a Counting-House door.\"",
