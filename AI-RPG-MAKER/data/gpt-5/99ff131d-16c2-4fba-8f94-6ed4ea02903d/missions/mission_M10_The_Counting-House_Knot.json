    "description": "The Granite Counting-House is cool and quiet as a ledger’s conscience. Dorel Glassant, torn between precision and pity, asks you to help untie a knot of numbers meant to strangle the joint writ you just won. A hidden star-code, read from the Heliolith’s prism by a Ledger reader at midnight, is being used to predict and pre-price the city’s future, an act that will let Avar Jen claim the prism as a financial instrument. You must infiltrate the private archive, copy the ligature cipher that unlocks the sealed prism chamber, and smuggle it into the hands of the Accord before the Ledger can rewrite your access.",

Take it, and take my shame with it if you must, but put it in a hand that will use it to open a door, not lock one.\"",

If Avar wants to own the future’s breath, he’ll have to hold it against a song sung by a city, not a clerk. When the door opens, Dorel, you testify. Not in the Ledger’s whisper-chamber.
