    "description": "At noon, the Heliolith’s hum falters like a singer swallowing grief mid-phrase. Bronze scaffolds tremble with a vibration only the worry-worn notice, and the glass-veins in the streets glow a heartbeat late. Arch-Condensor Meret Hal summons Tallea to the Sun-Ring galleries, where the Spire’s pale light needles through motes of condenser dust. Meret’s face is the face of a steward who counts breaths as currency, tired and unblinking. The Aquifer Collegium whispers of salt creep, the Veil Covenant chants of a missing note, and the Ledger counts the minutes like coin. Tallea feels it as a pressure at the edges of her scarred ear: the city is out of tune, and the faultline runs through engineering and rite both. To begin, the hum must be heard—truly heard—without the clamor of arguments crowding it.",

        "quest_giver_to_hero": "Meret Hal folds her hands around a cup of lukewarm condenser tea. \"You hear it, don’t you, Tallea? Not just the dimming, but the stagger in the breath. The Heliolith used to land at noon like a fisher to the knot, and now it misses. I can throw crews at frames until our palms blister and we will not catch a note that wandered out of reach. Go listen for me, but not as a clerk and not as a priestess. Go as the only kind of listener the city still trusts: one who has disappointed both sides and is still asked back.\"",
        "hero_reply": "Tallea rubs the blue ink-stain at her thumb. \"I hear it, and it hurts in a way I cannot show a ledger. If it’s harmonic fatigue, the Fork will sing in the fractures. If it’s a missing note, the kite will net the lull. Either way, I’ll bring you something I can stand behind in the Courts. I won’t sell a comfort to you or to the Covenant just to make the noise stop.\"",
