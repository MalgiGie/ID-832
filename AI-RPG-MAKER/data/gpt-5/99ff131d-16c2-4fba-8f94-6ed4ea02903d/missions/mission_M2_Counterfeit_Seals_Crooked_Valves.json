    "description": "The Cascadrome breathes for Aurelia, but someone has taught it to whisper favors. A string of accidents—slips on slick steps, lifts arriving light when they should be heavy—has sharpened the Compact’s temper. Thren Basso, all rope scars and steadied anger, leads Tallea to a row of frames where Blue-Timer queues sway in the heat. Valve housings wear the right seals, but when Tallea listens with her fork, she hears a private lull behind the official sigh. It is the sound of water diverted in secret, humming in bypass lines hidden behind brass plates polished by guilt. If the city’s breath is rationed, it cannot afford lungs with private straws.",

The kind that never had a private seal in their lives. The kind that reads ration edicts like scripture because it’s the only law that ever noticed them. If there are bypasses, I will rip them out with my own hands, but if I do it with my hands, the whole city will know by noon and we will have a riot by dusk. I need your ears to prove the lie, and your tongue to make the truth land quieter than a lift bell.\"",
        "hero_reply": "Tallea glances at the Blue-Timers, their hourglasses held against their chests like charms. \"I’ll make the valves sing their guilt into my fork and not into the crowd. If Tamsin has his fingers in this, I’ll pull them out without taking his whole hand. But if the bypass climbs up to a Counting-House ledger, don’t expect me to soften the blow.\"",
