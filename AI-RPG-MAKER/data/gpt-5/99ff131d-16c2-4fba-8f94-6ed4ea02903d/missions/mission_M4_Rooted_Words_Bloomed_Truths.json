    "description": "Seru Chime, a dusk-singer whose voice makes fog beads shiver, brings a request from the Veil Covenant that sounds like a test disguised as trust. The Tangle-Root Archive can grow a night-flower that teaches by dream, but only if fed a secret freely given. Your stolen breath is a secret that bites, and the grove is a patient judge. The Archive’s wardens thread bark-ribbons that glow with sap-letters, and the roots cradle jars of memory like sleeping infants. To walk among them is to feel pages turning underfoot. If the city’s missing note is to be restored, you must learn how to splice wind, water, and heat into one braid and not draw blood in the weave.",

The Archive listens differently than you or I; it drinks what hurts and gives back an answer that tastes like medicine. Bring it a truth you do not want weaponized and it will teach you how to braid. This is not a ritual to prove the Covenant right. It is a ritual to keep you alive when you climb into the Spire’s throat.\"",

I hated the theft even as I did it, and I have hated it in others since. If the grove will have that bitterness, I will pour it out. And if it answers me with a lesson, I will bring you a braid no faction can cut.\"",
