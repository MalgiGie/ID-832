    "description": "Ayo Solace proposes a remedy with equal parts science and scandal. The Syrinx Wind Courts are tuned in public, but under the flutes lies a sealed subchamber that hoards the city’s breath—the same illicit cache Tallea once dared to steal from. A controlled draw from that chamber, Ayo claims, could be mixed with enzyme and echo-stone to make a calibration tincture for the Heliolith’s pulse. But the Ledger keeps keys and schedules, and a single misstep in timing will spill the plan into the harps where truth becomes case law. To listen under law is to skate on glass humming with power.",
    "objectives": [
        "Acquire a midnight access window to the Syrinx subchamber by persuading wind-scribe Rhyss Quell.",
        "Synchronize with the aeolian harps and open the subchamber between notes without tripping the bell-scribes.",
        "Mix a small vial of breath-tincture using Solace enzymes on-site.",
        "Evade Ledger auditors led by Dorel Glassant and exit before the hour turns."

        "quest_giver_to_hero": "Ayo leans close enough for her balm to cool your cheek. \"I will not sanctify theft, Tallea. But I will sanctify a cure. The Courts have been collecting our breath for years in the name of record. If we draw a cup and return a cure that steadies the Courts themselves, who can object with a straight face? You time the lulls better than any clerk alive. I can mix the breath into a tincture that will teach your fork the city’s average note. Meet me at moon-tier, and bring courage dry enough not to squeak.\"",
        "hero_reply": "Tallea’s throat tightens around a memory of a stolen vial. \"If I step under the harps, I will hear every lie I ever spoke echo back at me. I’ll still go. Rhyss owes me a favor for the chain-pass audit and he hates the Ledger’s long fingers as much as I do. We do this clean, Ayo. If the harps catch us, we speak the plan aloud and dare the city to call it a crime.\"",
