    "description": "The Black Library of Scoria hums like a quiet forge, a temple to sharp memory where every page can cut and every silence is weighted like a counterbalance waiting to fall. You pass beneath a chain-bridge into the cooled lava bubble, donning reader’s gloves as your breath fogs against obsidian shelves etched with copper filigree that glints like embers trapped in glass. Scrolls inked in ash sleep in their alcoves with the prim poise of knives in velvet, and the walls swallow echoes as if the library distrusts careless sound. Maela Scor stands like a lamplight held steady, her mica-bright eyes reflecting your silhouette, and you feel the old dissonance in your throat—the map-song hum that once coaxed a hidden aisle to loosen. She has heard the Loom’s whispers and remembers the city’s famines and floods; she measures lives and engines with the same careful respect and expects you to do likewise. Somewhere behind the stacks, beneath shelves that never ring unless rung properly, lies a seam of knowledge sealed by a tune that has haunted your nights since guilt first taught you to hum softly behind your teeth. To open it now is to sign your name in heat, to bind voice to ledger, to let witnesses see whether you sing for pride or for Skarnhold. The air tastes of old copper and warm stone, the perfume of a thousand careful readings, and you know that when the shelf glides the scent will bloom like a memory stepped from shadow into sun. In this place the Pact breathes through glass, and even the smallest note must be held to the weight of its consequence.",

            "lines": "You carry the after-hours hush about you like a cloak, Neris Coilglass, and the glass remembers such cloaks even when their wearers beg to be unnoticed. Do not waste your breath on denial; this chamber does not echo for thieves unless it wishes to keep their lies as curiosities, and today it is in no mood to collect. If you intend to open the shelf, do it in my sight, with your hands gloved, your ink narrow, and your intent set like a stone on a scale that all present may read. Here we do not steal; we trade, and the price is responsibility measured not in coin but in continuance of the city—engines running, barges lifting, and the river free to remember its paths. Can you bear that price, and can you promise that the hum you loose will return to this room in ledgered form rather than wander the Chainquarter as a rumor with teeth."

            "lines": "The note has lived in my throat like a shard, aching when I lie down and singing when I try to be silent, and I have let it guide a hand once when fear and need made a smaller creature of me than I wished to be. I will not offer you a clever lie to polish my shame; I touched what was sealed because I believed the city might cool if I did not, and because pride makes excuses as readily as it makes tools. Today I stand in your sight and ask the ledger to hold my voice steady, so that if I slip again the record will catch me and the city will not. I will hum what must be hummed, and I will bind that hum to the ink you keep, and in return I ask leave to copy what keeps our engines balanced and our gates singing instead of choking. If I have trespassed, let this be the counterweight: witness, ink, and a promise to report every anomaly the river or the gyres whisper to me."

            "speaker": "Maela Scor",
            "lines": "Then we shall do this as we do all difficult readings—methodically, with the doors watched and the bells quiet. You will copy only what you need, with ash-ink trimmed to needles and margins left generous enough to cradle a mistake without letting it spill; the Orin folk were spared nothing by gravity, and we are spared nothing by haste. The Feathered Gyre tolerances are not lines to skim past when the page shines prettily; treat them as you would a bridge over a wind-sliced gulf, one careful step and then another. When the shelf loosens, you will feel warm air like a breath from an old forge, and that is your reminder that heat is life and life burns when mishandled; let it guide your hands, not quicken them. Leave a breath of your voice here in our ledger and take with you a breath of our trust, but know that both breaths will be counted if ever the bells ring blue over the Underrun because a note escaped this room unguided."

            "lines": "I will stand within earshot, and my tally will keep time with your hum so that the library, not gossip, holds the tune thereafter; do not mistake my quiet for indifference, for quiet is the first tool we use to shape dangerous knowledge. When you begin, I will tap the shelf in an old Scorian cadence, and if the glass answers wrongly we stop, take tea, and begin again, because stubbornness breaks more shelves than ignorance. Your copies will be weighed by sight and by breath, matched to their originals by heat-seal and by cadence marks, and if a line wavers I will ask you to confess the wobble to the margin so the next pair of eyes does not fall where you stumbled. When the bell-intervals of the Singing Gate are transcribed, I will read them aloud on the librarian’s breath and you will write what you hear rather than what you hope, for hope is a poor stenographer. May the words you carry return to Skarnhold as food and not as fire, as pathways opened and not as debts multiplied; that is the blessing we give here, and it is not light."

            "text": "You step into the center of the reading room and bow your head so the brass lamplight gilds your chipped horn, and you speak plainly about the night you hummed the shelf alone. You describe the fear that drove you, the pride that gilded it, and the way the tune felt too easy, as if it had been waiting for your mouth since birth. You ask Maela and the attendant to witness your hum and your hands, to match your breath to the ledger’s script, and to keep you honest should your ambition outrun your caution again. You name your allies and debts without ornament, so that no shadow can later purchase your silence with a coin you have already spent here in daylight. You end by promising that every anomaly you meet in river or gear will be walked back to this room like a lantern brought in from dangerous wind.",
            "outcome": "Maela nods with the slow certainty of a counterweight settling, and the room’s hush warms as if the library has accepted an overdue tithe of truth; the aisle yields to your hum without protest. The Scorians record your voiceprint beside the map-song, branding your honesty into the ledger like a heat-seal that will not lift, and they grant you longer reading windows under watch. Word of your confession reaches two places at once: to the Oracle Loom as a mark in your favor, and to a handful of Emberwatch clerks who appreciate clarity even when it paints you a shade darker on their lists. In the Chainquarter, a Chainwright apprentice hears and decides that if the Orin notes must be copied, they would rather it be by hands that stand in the open, and a door you did not know you needed creaks inward on a future day. You leave with the copies, the token, and a reputation tempered in the library’s heat, and you feel how the same hum sits in your throat now like a tamed spark that will burn only where you bid it."

            "text": "You admit you know the tune and that you have felt its pull, but you let your words move like careful feet over a rope-bridge: steady, deliberate, and never lunging too far ahead. You speak of the city’s need, of engines that falter if not fed precise intervals, and of rivers that mislead the proud when storms echo in stone, and you ask to proceed under strictest supervision. You do not list every trespass, but you offer what matters now: your willingness to bind your breath to the ledger and to accept penalties if any page you copy strays from the library’s law. You ask Maela to set the terms of your access and to judge you by the weight of your conduct in this room rather than by rumors that have grown like moss over stone. You promise that your hum will remain a library tool and not a tavern trick, and that you will choose silence over cleverness if ever you find yourself tempted to improvise with a dangerous note.",
            "outcome": "Maela’s mouth tilts in a line that is neither smile nor frown, and in that fine balance you recognize the mercy of a librarian who trusts practice above confession; she agrees, and the attendant sets a closer chair. Your access is granted by the narrowest margin, and your copies will be checked twice, then thrice, with cadence stamps pressed so precisely that your margins bear tiny constellations of trust verified. The Scorians make quiet note that you chose measured truth, and they file your name among those who may yet learn to carry heavy knowledge without dropping it in a crowd. The rumor of your restraint travels softer than a confession would, but it travels farther among cautious folk who prefer hands that do what they say over throats that ring loudly with penitence. You leave with what you came for and a tally of watchfulness at your back, and as you step onto the chain-bridge the hum feels less like a song you own and more like a tool that owns rules, which you have agreed to follow."

            "title": "Private Opening Under Oath and Closed Doors",
            "text": "You ask Maela for a closed-door reading with only her as witness, arguing that too many ears make tunes wander and that the map-song prefers a smaller chamber to keep its pitch true. You offer an oath by the Pact’s heat, swearing that your prior trespass will be paid forward in work and in reporting, and that no third ear will leave the room with a note you did not intend. You admit that certain factions listen hard when your name is spoken and that a public binding would feed their hunger more than it would feed the city, and you ask her to weigh the difference. You promise to sign the ledger in the margins reserved for sensitive works, to accept any seal or sigil she sets upon your copies, and to submit to additional audits at the Loom if that eases her mind. You add that you will return with any echo you hear, any drift in the bell-intervals, and any whisper of the Feathered Gyre that does not match its tolerances as described, binding your future to the carefulness of this moment.",
            "outcome": "Maela considers and then grants the request, not as a favor but as a test, and the reading room’s attendant steps outside the door with a bell you can summon if anything goes out of tune; privacy here is a rare alloy tempered with scrutiny. The shelf loosens at your hum with a faint warmth like a hand taken from a pocket, and Maela’s eyes narrow as if measuring the exact degree to which the glass approves of your pitch. Your copies are stamped with a discreet Scorian cipher that will reveal tampering if the pages are ever shown where they should not be, and your ledger entry is sealed in a case that opens only for library elders. A whisper of your private reading escapes despite the closed door, carried not by mouths but by the habitual gossip of opened spaces, and the Veil and Ledger mark your name again with a quirk of interest that may cost or profit you later depending on which scale they tilt. You leave with the same knowledge and token, but also with a thread that ties you more tightly to Maela’s personal tolerance, and you understand that such threads hold as long as you help bear their weight rather than yank them for leverage."
