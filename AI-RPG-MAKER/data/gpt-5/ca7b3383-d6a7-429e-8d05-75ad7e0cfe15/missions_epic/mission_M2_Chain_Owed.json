    "description": "The Chainheart roars like caged thunder as counterweights breathe and chains sing their iron hymns, a metallic choir rising through open wells to the Sunward Ledges and plunging down toward the Underrun. Steam licks the brass chevrons of the catwalks and paints the air in pearly veils, making even the foremen look like saints in an engine’s chapel. Riven Hask stands in the tremoring light, his hands nicked into a ledger of old accidents, and his eyes read your Loom writ the way a pilot reads currents that want to drown. The gyres hum and stutter with a ghostly wobble that flutters the copper flags, and every tremor sends murmurs through the lift crews like wind through chainvine. Below the inspection cage, warm drips make the air taste of blood and pennies, and somewhere a bell strikes blue to warn that a mid-level cradle is shivering off-tempo. You feel the city breathe through your boots: an intake before a long pull, a hush before a shout, a pulse you have learned to hear in glass fibers and ash-ink. Past a grating where the oil sheen gathers in rainbow slicks, Sere Vell steps from dusk like a folded letter, carrying the scent of clean ink and the promise of problems that vanish on paper before they can tear skin. Between the hiss of vents and the heartbeat of gyres, your own pulse learns the rhythm, and the chipped edge of your left horn remembers the Mines where one wrong note drew blood. The Chainheart is both cathedral and beast, and it understands only those who keep time with its hunger.",
    "objectives": [
        "Present the Loom writ to Riven Hask at the Chainheart and request provisional access to schedule blocks.",
        "Stabilize a stuttering gyre using the Feather-Gyre Calibrator without stopping the lift.",
        "Retrieve a fallen counterweight tooth from the sump and deliver it to the gearwrights.",
        "Decide whether to share a copied, redacted schedule page with Sere Vell or refuse their offer.",
        "Report to Riven with a functioning gyre and a clear log of your interventions."

            "lines": "Prophecies do not keep balconies from tearing loose, and copper basins do not catch men when they fall. I have watched good people slip between rungs because some schedule thought it could stand still and let fate do the lifting. You want a look at our blocks and bells, you show me a steady hand on a live gyre while she is singing full-throat, and you bring back what my crew dropped without breaking your neck or mine. Words are wind in here; iron is grammar, and blood is the punctuation that comes when someone fails to read. Prove you can keep time with the Chainheart instead of telling us what hour it ought to be, and maybe then I will write your name on a chit that matters. Until then, your Loom writ is just a piece of paper trying to argue with a moving city."

            "lines": "It is not a crime to make information flow, darling; it is the art that keeps a city from clotting in its own veins. Think of the Veil as the oil you never see, the drop that keeps a heated axle from shrieking itself into shrapnel. A page, redacted to the point of poetry, nothing dangerous, and in return your requests float to the top of stacks that would otherwise drown you in other people’s emergencies. No gates kicked, no locks broken, only a correction to the drift of priorities, and all of it deniable should some brass-masked conscience take interest. The Chainwrights believe physics is law; we simply believe influence is physics by other means, and we apply the gentlest force at precisely the right lever. You carry so many promises in that Loom script of yours; let me make sure they do not get lost in a gust of policy."

            "lines": "People say chain-songs are harsh, but when your ear rests against the riser and your breath eases, there is a tenderness in the harmonics like hands passing weight without letting it fall. Each tooth that bites into its partner is a vow kept; each gyre spin is a stanza that only ends when fear stops it. I have felt how a wrong note shivers through a lift and makes balconies think about plummets they were not built to remember. The Feather-Gyre Calibrator hums in my palm like a fledgling learning the shape of wind, and I tell it a story of balance until its spin falls into the city’s heartbeat. Down in the sump, where drips count seconds the way monks count prayers, I will find your fallen tooth and bring it back like a name you thought you had forgotten. I am not here to boss the hour; I am here to help the hour arrive without blood."

            "lines": "You kept the lift singing without strangling it, and you brought my tooth back polished by grit but unbroken, which tells me you understand both patience and pressure. Word travels faster than steam in here, and the way the cradle leveled under your hands has already found three different mouths and a fourth that does not gossip unless it must. Take this provisional access chit and do not make me regret the scratch it puts into my authority, because the Chainheart has a long memory for those who keep it from grinding itself apart. Bring me logs that read clean, and I will consider more windows into our timings than you thought possible. Pull one stunt that makes a lift stall when it ought to run, and I will make sure every door you hope to open is locked with the weight of a thousand counterweights. For today, you earned an hour of my trust, and that is heavier than it sounds."

            "title": "Pass the Grease: Share the Redacted Page with Sere Vell",
            "text": "You copy a single schedule slice onto ash-ink vellum with a hand that knows exactly where to blur, black out, and fold the truth so it cannot be unfolded by anyone who does not already know it. You strip the page of live names, remove the teeth counts that would matter, and turn the precise minutes into a rhythm that is only useful for easing a desk’s reluctance to notice your requests. You leave the watermark of the Loom intact just enough to echo, a reassurance and a warning both, so the page looks brave but not brazen. You tell yourself you are not breaking the Pact of First Heat but honoring its intent, because a city that will not move for survival deserves a nudge. You hand Sere the page in the shadow of a vent that whispers like a confessional, and you hear your mother’s lost-remembered voice say be careful not to make a habit of shortcuts. As Sere tucks the page away with fingers that never sweat, you realize that grease is not just oil; it is a promise to keep lifting without seizing.",
            "outcome": "Sere Vell’s smile is the kind you hang a lantern in, soft and practical, and your next three requisitions float to the top of the Chainwrights’ tray like driftwood that refuses to drown. A quiet favor settles over you like a cloak cut to your measure, invisible until the rain begins, and the Veil and Ledger mark your file as an asset that pays attention. The Emberwatch’s brass masks do not turn your way, but you feel an accounting breeze pass over your shoulders as if someone wrote your name into a ledger with a pencil, not ink. Riven does not know and does not ask, though he squints once at the scent of clean ink and decides he has more urgent machines to worry about as long as your logs read straight. The city breathes a fraction easier around your work, and you wonder if the line between kindness and complicity is simply whether anyone falls because of what you gave away. Nothing in your official reward changes hands today, but you have a shadow-coin to spend when the next stuck door refuses to admit it has hinges."

            "text": "You keep the writ in your pocket and the schedules in your head, and you let the silence answer the offer with a stillness that even steam respects. You say that balance is not only a machine but a promise, and promises are the first teeth to crack when grease turns into a solvent. You explain, without heat, that you would rather fight through proper channels and bruise your knuckles on honest doors than polish your way through a gate that forgets why it stands. You watch the way Sere’s eyes count you and decide that today you are not a lever that moves, and the thought relieves you more than it disappoints you. You consider the Pact and the egg you may never see, and you think that if a dragon must be kept warm by motion, then the motions must be ones the city can live with. You leave with your hands as clean as your conscience allows in a place that runs on oil and compromise.",
            "outcome": "Sere Vell’s smile folds closed like a ledger at dusk, polite and unreadable, and you feel the lack of grease as your next requests take the long, honest road through the Chainwrights’ paper engines. A small, quiet nod reaches you from Riven in the way he stops looking for the scent of dusk-ink when you bring a log, and there is an extra half-beat of trust when you touch a live gyre under his gaze. The Veil and Ledger write a question mark next to your name and decide to try a different lever next time, which is its own form of safety. Nothing leaps to help you when a door sticks, but nothing dangerous leans to listen when you whisper your needs either, and there is a blessed hush in that kind of solitude. Your official rewards remain unchanged, unshaded by shadow debts, and your reputation with the Chainwrights rests on iron instead of favors. You walk away knowing that the city’s breath you felt through the beam was yours too, and you chose not to spend it on a shortcut."
