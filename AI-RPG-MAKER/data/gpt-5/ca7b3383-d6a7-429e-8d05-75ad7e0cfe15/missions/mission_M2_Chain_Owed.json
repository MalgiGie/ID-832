    "description": "The Chainheart roars like caged thunder as counterweights breathe and chains sing their iron hymns. Riven Hask, a foreman with hands nicked into a ledger of old accidents, studies the Loom writ you present and frowns like a closed gate. Access to the Chainheart’s schedules is a currency more guarded than coin. Prove yourself in iron and motion, he says, and we will talk. A gyre in a mid-level cradle stutters when the lift shimmies, tossing balconies into panic and delaying work crews. Down a sump-ladder, where warm drips make the air taste metallic, a broken counterweight tooth waits to be reclaimed. In the shadows beyond the inspection cage, Sere Vell steps out smelling of clean ink and dusk with an offer to make paperwork flow smoother than oil. The floor thrums underfoot. If you place your palm to a beam you can feel the city breathing.",
    "objectives": [
        "Present the Loom writ to Riven Hask at the Chainheart and request provisional access to schedule blocks.",
        "Stabilize a stuttering gyre using the Feather-Gyre Calibrator without stopping the lift.",
        "Retrieve a fallen counterweight tooth from the sump and deliver it to the gearwrights.",
        "Decide whether to share a copied, redacted schedule page with Sere Vell or refuse their offer.",
        "Report to Riven with a functioning gyre and a clear log of your interventions."

You want schedules, you show me a steady hand on a live gyre and bring back what my crew dropped without breaking your neck or mine. Do that, and I will believe you can keep time with us instead of just telling us what hour it ought to be."

A page, redacted, nothing dangerous, and in return your requests stop getting lost under a drift of other people’s emergencies. Think of it as grease for a machine that would seize without it."

Take this access chit and do not make me regret it. The Chainheart has long memory for those who keep it from grinding itself apart."
