    "description": "Skarnhold holds its breath. Lifts hang polite in their slots, the bells at the Underrun glow blue, and the city’s pulse narrows into one planned motion. Jask Lumenwright takes your hand and places in it a folded edict that is not an order so much as a promise signed in heat. The Iron Cradle must take the egg on a slow river run to the Singing Gate and back, not to deliver it away, but to teach the city’s lifelines to remember its motion together. Neris Undersong stands at the helm; Riven Hask guards the gyre with a wrench and a curse; Nemra Coil hums a lullaby older than the glass under your feet. Emberwatch wardens line the docks without masks, watching the crowd watch itself. The river inhales, the bell sings an impossible chord, and for a breath the world below the Rift opens like a second Skarnhold made of shadow and patience. You steer the cradle into that chord and feel the egg’s beat steady into a rhythm the whole city can keep.",
    "objectives": [
        "Receive the Loom’s edict from Jask and brief all participating factions on roles and contingencies.",
        "Guide the Iron Cradle barge from the Underrun Docks to the Singing Gate using the map-song and blue-bell code.",
        "Navigate luring currents and avoid a territorial stonewhale by syncing gyre spin to the whale’s song.",
        "Pass through the Singing Gate during the exact bell-interval and return without stopping the cradle’s motion.",
        "Conclude with a Quiet Pour at the docks, returning measured jugs of warm water to the Ireflow to seal the pact."
