    "description": "A borrowed testing bay in the Chainquarter smells of hot oil and hope. Ilara Embervein rolls up their Loom-woven sleeves to reveal cinder marks that pulse gently when the engine breathes. Star-crystal facets slot into sockets around the Feathered Gyre like teeth into a careful mouth. You lace ember-threads and map-song harmonics through the frame until the whole device wants to move even at rest. Outside, footsteps hesitate. Sere Vell leans in the doorway with concern that is either real or well-practiced, warning that someone less subtle than them means to ruin your first spin for reasons that add up in a ledger you will never see. Nemra Coil arrives with a clutch of Orphans who lay iron feathers at the door and hum a child’s Coilnight rhyme to bless the bearings. When you thrum the gyre, the cradle turns and the air shivers as if a distant heart kept time.",
    "objectives": [
        "Assemble the Iron Cradle prototype with Ilara Embervein using the Feathered Gyre and star-crystal facets.",
        "Calibrate the cradle with the Loom’s First Harmonic Coil and the Singing Gate intervals at low power.",
        "Prevent sabotage by identifying and disarming a sand-sugar dump aimed at fouling the bearings.",
        "Invite Nemra Coil to perform a Pact blessing and decide whether to credit the Orphans publicly.",
        "Record full spin data in a neutral ledger for cross-guild review."

Someone in a cleaner coat than mine wants your bearings to grind themselves to powder, preferably in front of a dozen witnesses. Check the grease for grit and check the grit for sweet. Sand-sugar tastes like victory until it eats your machine."

Let the record show we are not children playing with a story. We are caretakers keeping a promise in motion."
