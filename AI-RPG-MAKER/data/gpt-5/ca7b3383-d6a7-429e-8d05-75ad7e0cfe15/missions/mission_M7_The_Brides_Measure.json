    "description": "Whisperfen does not decide between steam and frost, so it keeps both. Reed-specters comb the fog and return with bits of voices they sell to hungry pools. Yevra Ashleaf meets you under a bell stake, eyes ringed with smokeherb silver. The Bride of Mist waits where three plumes cross, and she demands tender coin: the memory of something that makes you yourself. She will trade you a path by sound to anywhere you know, but the path collapses if you speak a true name. You have already paid her once in secret. Now, you must bring her a memory you can spare and ask for a route that turns the city inside out, so you can enter the Wound without drawing the Emberwatch’s gaze. The bog gurgles as if laughing at your balance.",

        "Meet Yevra Ashleaf at the Whisperfen bell stakes and receive ritual guidance for avoiding true names.",
        "Gather a sprig of smokeherb with silver veins as an offering and place it at the crossing of three plumes.",
        "Trade a lesser memory to the Bride of Mist in exchange for a breath-path to Aelmyr’s Wound that masks your heat-signature.",
        "Use the Vent-Pearl Pair to store the path’s breath and avoid voice-thief specters.",
        "Return with a sealed whisper describing the path without speaking it."

Give me a different sweetness. Give me the taste of a first success, perhaps, or the sound of a promise that you almost broke and did not. In return, I will stitch you a quiet between law and legend."
