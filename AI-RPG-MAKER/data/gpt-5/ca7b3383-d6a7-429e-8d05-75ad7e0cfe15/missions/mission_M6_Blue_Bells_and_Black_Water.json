    "description": "The Underrun breathes a warm fog that smells of iron and eel oil. Blue bells hang under the cavern arch and glow like sleep caught in glass. Neris Undersong leans from a barge with ink-stained fingers and a voice like a low oar stroke. The River Covenant is holding a blue-bell auction, not for coin but for favors and future passages. If you want the collapsible dock code and a pilot token that whispers to wardens, you must approach like a bargeman, not a clerk. The current here talks in little eddies that mimic voices you trust. Your Vent-Pearl Pair will be more than tool; they will be promise and line back to air. The bells ring and the crowd shifts as if the river itself changed its mind.",
    "objectives": [
        "Attend the blue-bell auction at the Underrun Docks and register under Neris Undersong’s sponsorship.",
        "Bid a favor and a salt-scrip voucher for the collapsible dock release code tied to the Singing Gate passage frame.",
        "Pilot a skiff through luring currents to demonstrate competency with reedstone hums without capsizing.",
        "Receive and memorize a wet-ledger passphrase recognized by River Covenant wardens.",
        "Share a copy of the Library’s map-song intervals with Neris Undersong in confidence."
