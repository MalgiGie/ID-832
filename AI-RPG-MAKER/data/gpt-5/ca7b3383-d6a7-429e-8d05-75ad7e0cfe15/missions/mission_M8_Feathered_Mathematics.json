    "description": "The Skybridge Ruins of Orin still hum in a wind that knows equations. Pelyn Orinfae tugs a scarf tight against the shear and points at a half-buried pylon where lightning snakes once nested and left the metal tasting like rain. The Feathered Gyre you need is inside, and it does not like to be touched without being told a story about weight and motion that pleases it. Vara Keshlin, seconded from the Chainwrights for the day, watches for fraying ropes and stupid bravery. Hawkweed brushes your calves as you edge onto stone that feels lighter than it should. Below, the Rift’s breath lifts a whisper from the abyss that almost sounds like your name. The pylon door groans when you speak the map-song’s quiet places, and inside the Gyre still spins very slowly, as if remembering a city in the clouds.",

        "Retrieve the Feathered Gyre core without stopping its spin and secure it in a counterweighted sling.",
        "With Vara Keshlin, test the gyre’s response to load stories and record its preferences.",
        "Return to Skarnhold and sign the Chainwright custody ledger for joint stewardship."
