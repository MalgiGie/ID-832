    "description": "The Saltfold Exchange sounds like a hive of bells and sharp voices. On the terraced galleries, clerks knot cords with fingers so fast they blur, while brass mirrors catch lots and bounce them to ledgers. Breg Tesserin meets you with a smile that means arithmetic and a ring that smells of brine. The Salt Charter will not oppose your engine time if you can stitch a truce at the edges, shaving a hiss from tariffs just long enough to move parts and food in tandem. The Price-Bell hangs over all of it, and you can feel the city’s appetite measured in its chime. In the shadows below the rail knots, Sere Vell circles with a little book of names and cuts that would make two enemies shake hands for a day or two. Laughter collapses into a hush as a blue lot of brine pearls is raised. The taste of salt fills your mouth like a warning.",

Give me a day when your engines will require lifts and I will give you pennies shaved from tariffs on that day and that day only. In return, the Stewards get their bins up the chains without begging. We both remember who arranged it and we both smile."

I can tie a similar knot for you, a neat loop to hide a bruise. You will owe me a thread. I am not asking you to sell your soul, Neris. Just remember who kept the book clean when the numbers were not."
