        "description": "Lean and long-limbed with ember-flecked umber skin and a soot-dark pair of swept-back horns. Copper-threaded black hair is bound in a rigger’s knot, and pale heat-sheen lingers in golden irises. Usually wears a vent-cloak over Loom-woven glassfiber sleeves, fingers stained with ash-ink.",
        "distinctive_signs": "Left horn is chipped from a glassfall in the Shatter Mines; a cinder-mark in the shape of a chain link glows faintly along the jaw when standing over warm vents."

    "history": "Born on the Sunward Ledges to a lampwright family who trimmed lantern-kites for the Glass Sea caravans, Neris grew up reading the city’s moods by the taste of steam and the song of chainwheels. Caught sketching the ripples in a copper basin outside the Oracle Loom, they were taken in as a late acolyte by Jask Lumenwright, who taught them to hear futures in heat-harmonics. When the Loom whispered of an Iron Cradle that must keep an egg in motion or all will cool to ruin, Neris chose the path between factions, courting Chainwrights for engines and the Orphans of Aelmyr for pact-lore. A shatterwight raid in the Mines left Neris with a horn scar and a debt to Tosk Glassbite, while quiet ration deals with Rukha Mossbank kept experiments running when the Salt Charter squeezed prices. Neris now works between the Chainquarter and the Oracle Loom, building portable cradles that circulate heat using scavenged Orin gyres and ember-thread coils. They are tolerated by Emberwatch when drills need augury and despised when omens close lifts. Rumors say Neris has piloted a skiff through a blue-bell night at the Underrun and heard a heartbeat at Aelmyr’s Wound on Coilnight. Each project inches the city toward a choice: honor the Pact fully by setting the egg in motion, or watch the lifelines be taxed into stasis by fear and profit.",
