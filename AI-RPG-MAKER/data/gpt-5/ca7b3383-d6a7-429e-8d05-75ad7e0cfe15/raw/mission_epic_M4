Lantern mirrors rake the terraces with glints that look like scattered coins, and clerks’ fingers whip cords into algebraic knots whose curves hold the day’s fate more tightly than any oath. You feel the city’s appetite in the bell’s low throat, a living hunger that wants metal, grain, oil, and the comfort of predictable heat. Breg Tesserin waits beneath an awning striped like a ledger, smiling a mathematician’s smile that weighs favors against futures; the rings on his hands smell faintly of brine and old caravans. Below the rail knots, Sere Vell prowls like a shadowed accountant, her little book of names flicking open and closed as if it could drink a quarrel and spit out a truce. Far across the galleries, a raised tray flashes blue—the brine pearls—and the sound around it tightens into a wire; you can already taste the salt, sharp and warning as a bitten lip. Steam from the basin vents beads on copper gutters, dripping in time with the bells, and the whole Exchange seems to shiver as if the city itself waited for you to declare how the day will be balanced. Today the pact you seek is not a priest’s vow but a traveler’s bargain: a day’s worth of shaved tariffs braided to the precise hours your cradle parts and the Stewards’ food bins must rise together, and a written addendum binding that mercy to the Quiet Pour so the river is remembered when the ledgers are closed. Threads of rumor tug at your ears—Emberwatch sniffing audits, runners balking at synchronized slots, the Veil and Ledger offering to make one column bleed into another until it looks like fairness—and somewhere beneath it all, the Price-Bell keeps counting the city’s pulse.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Breg Tesserin on the Saltfold Exchange’s east terrace and discuss temporary tariff relief tied to cradle freight windows.\",\n        \"Convince a skeptical runner clique to accept synchronized lift slots for foodstuffs and machine parts.\",\n        \"Win a bid for a small crate of brine pearls used in heat exchange without triggering an Emberwatch audit.\",\n        \"Choose whether to accept Sere Vell’s offer to mask a minor loss to make the numbers look fair.\",\n        \"Secure a written charter addendum tying tariff relief to Quiet Pour contributions.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Breg Tesserin\", \"lines\": \"Price is memory and memory is power, and both live longer when they are treated kindly. I remember the last time your auguries shaved a crisis down to a manageable cut, and I remember the time you closed a lift with a whisper and cost me three crates of profit; I keep both in my mouth like salt. Give me your precise hours of motion and I will trim our tariffs so fine that even the brass scales will not feel the difference, and I will do it for those hours only, so the favor glows but does not burn. In that window, the Terrace-Stewards’ food bins climb beside your cradle parts, and the Exchange keeps its dignity because the bell does not ring a lie. We both remember who arranged it, we both smile, and we both pretend, for the sake of order, that we are merely obeying the city’s own rhythm.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sere Vell\", \"lines\": \"Look closely at the knots along this rail; see how one loop holds tension for two opposing strands without snapping either, and yet, from a distance, looks like simple grace. There is a story braided there about two enemies who could not share a street and still managed to share a schedule, and it kept Skarnhold fed across a bad season. I can tie such a knot in your ledger—just a thread of shadow to pad a nicked column so no audit hound smells blood where there is only bruised arithmetic. You will owe me a thread, yes, but not your voice or your oath; a thread cuts easily if you pull it right, and I will teach you where to pull if ever we quarrel. I am not asking you to sell your soul, Neris Coilglass; I am offering you a crease in the page where mercy can hide a moment until the city has the strength to look it in the eye.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yevra Ashleaf\", \"lines\": \"Synchronized slots always sound clean to the mouths that have never hauled a chain out of rhythm, but our boots know every bad step in the Chainquarter and they remember the bruises. You want runners to stack food and machine parts on the same beat, and I hear the sense in it, but when a wind-gust shoves the chain and a counterweight yawns, it will be my crew’s shoulders that pay. Give me more than a promise and a poet’s timetable; give me melt-chit for overtime, a spare gyre’s whisper for the worst of the sway, and a written clause that the Exchange will eat the delay if a vent coughs in our faces. We don’t fear work, we fear being blamed for the city’s habit of pretending the vents sing lullabies instead of warnings. Talk to me like you have stood in the oil-stink with the mask pinching your nose, and maybe I will talk to my people like you are asking for a favor we can carry without snapping our backs.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rukha Mossbank\", \"lines\": \"The terraces bruise easily when the lifts stutter, and mushrooms do not wait politely while the Salt Charter counts its knots. If your day of shaved tariffs can float our bins without putting us in the Emberwatch’s teeth, then I will stand beside you under the bell and say so even if it singes a few whiskers. I will also say this: if we tie this relief to the Quiet Pour by writing, we teach the Exchange that generosity is not a fluke but a ritual, and rituals make habits, and habits keep people fed when the city hums too loud to hear itself. I will bargain for the runners’ hazard allowances, because a bruised shoulder still carries less grief than a hungry child, and I will sign my name to that bargain where every steward can see it. Bring me the slate, bring me the pen warmed over steam, and we will make a promise that does not crack when the vent winds change.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ilara Embervein\", \"lines\": \"I walk this terrace with a brass mask because heat can be an enemy’s grin as easily as a forge’s smile, and I have seen ledgers ignite from the friction of ambition. Blue lots draw flies, and flies draw audits, and audits draw raids when someone insists on using cleverness to dodge the rules written to keep the city from eating its own thumbs. If you intend to bid, bid clean and bid steady; if you intend to hide your purpose, hide it so well that even your allies cannot betray you by accident. Know this: I am not your enemy if your work keeps people alive and your numbers tell no infected lies, but I will be the hammer that falls if the bell hears deceit it cannot swallow. The Emberwatch prefers fires in forges, not on auction floors, and you will find we can be surprisingly patient when patience keeps the peace.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Auction Caller\", \"lines\": \"Blue lot upon the sunward rail, nine jars of brine pearls sealed and glow-certed, rattled by the river and sung over by three honest pilots who would sell their tongues before they sold a false light. Begin your bids at pain-of-tongue plus three, and if you talk faster than your purse you will choke on your own echo, so measure your breath. No hand waves here; we mark with knot and bell, and the bell does not forgive wishful thinking. The jars gleam like moons drowned under salt, and the Exchange leans in to watch you try to teach numbers how to dance without stepping on their toes. Speak clear, spend clean, and let’s see if the river’s memory favors your name today.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Coilglass\", \"lines\": \"I have walked the Chainquarter in a lifted fog when the gears sang loud enough to rattle teeth, and I have listened for omens in a copper basin until my fingers wrinkled like old paper. If your salt keeps food from rotting and my cradle keeps heat from scattering, then we are both stewards whether we dare the name or not. I will bind schedules tight enough that food and parts rise on the same breath, and I will not cut the river short or thicken a ledger that cannot bear it. Give me a day measured in honest bells and I will give you motion that pays back its favor by keeping the city’s heart beating where it belongs. If we must write mercy into law so that no one forgets how it sounded, then place the slate before me and I will sign with ash-ink that does not wash away in steam.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Accept Sere Vell’s masked-loss ledger knot\", \"text\": \"You lower your voice and let the crowd’s bell-song swallow the edges of your assent, and Sere’s smile is the kind that knows the weight of a thread and how far it stretches. You tell her that the city needs a crease in the page today and that you are willing to owe a small, neat debt if it means food and machine parts share a chain without drawing blood. You ask for the knot to be tight enough that even a hungry audit will taste ink before it tastes meat, and Sere nods like a seamstress measuring a difficult sleeve. You promise to remember the hand that softened the number, and you promise a future favor that will not harm those who eat at your table. You feel the risk settle into your pocket like a coin with an unfamiliar mint, warm and heavy, and you tell yourself it will spend clean when the time comes.\", \"outcome\": \"The Exchange inhales as your bids and bargains roll out with a suspicious smoothness, and somehow the brine pearls come to your hands without a single Emberwatch eyebrow rising. Breg’s arithmetic smile widens a notch, because the day’s rhythm stays intact and the Stewards’ bins climb without bumping elbows, and the Price-Bell rings a satisfied, even tone. Yevra’s runners grumble but accept the hazard clauses and overtime chits, soothed by the way delays vanish like morning mist, and their shoulders do not leave blood on the chain. Rukha signs the Quiet Pour addendum beside your name, and in the hot breath of the crowd you feel a little hope cool into something you can hold. Later, in a place where ledgers whisper and favors breed, Sere Vell will open her little book to your page and tap it with one finger, reminding you that a thread can hold a city—or cinch a throat—depending on how it’s pulled.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Refuse the shadow and demand daylight arithmetic\", \"text\": \"You hold Sere’s gaze and tell her that any mercy worth keeping must be written where the bell can read it and not tucked under the rail as if it were shame. You say that the city has learned too often that a hidden kindness grows mold, and that your bargains must be brave enough to walk across the terrace without a mask. You offer respect, not secrecy, and you promise to weave the truce from open knots that any inspector can follow with a finger. You admit the risk—that a clean line can also be a target—and still you choose it, because the cradle you build must carry weight without wobbling. You turn your attention back to Breg, to Rukha, and to Yevra’s crew, determined to make the day work on the strength of visible law and not the quicksilver of clever disguise.\", \"outcome\": \"The bidding is slower and the crowd’s eyes sharper, but your purse holds, your voice does not shake, and the brine pearls are won with a price that tastes honest even if it stings. Emberwatch watches, and Ilara’s mask tilts, and in that measured scrutiny you feel a grudging respect settle over your ledger like a seal pressed clean and deep. Breg’s smile is smaller but steadier; he appreciates that a favor written in daylight can be referenced without invoking ghosts, and he adjusts his trim to keep your hour sacred. Yevra’s runners get their hazard clauses and a promise of clocked lift-windows that shall not be shifted without their say, and they leave muttering that at least if they are blamed, it will be for truth and not for another’s hidden knot. Sere’s little book snaps shut with a gentle click that is not a threat, but neither is it a blessing; in some later hour you may find the Veil and Ledger letting you walk a road without a lantern where a lamp would have been convenient.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Proxy-bid through Rukha and the Terrace-Stewards to avoid an audit’s glare\", \"text\": \"You step back from the rail and let Rukha’s harvest-smelling cloak take point, and together you weave a story that is perfectly true: brine pearls for heat exchange in mushroom vaults, no more glamorous than breath in winter. You feed her the bid increments like a whisper of steam, rising at odd intervals that sync to lull periods between patrol sweeps, and she knots each number with a farmer’s patience. You play small, then sleep, then small again, never flashy, only inevitable, and the crowd accepts the fiction that this purchase is duller than it is. You keep your eyes down when the blue lot turns your way, and you refuse to lick your lips, because hunger draws hawks. By the time the final bell taps, the jars are yours by proxy and the Exchange has already turned its attention to a fistfight over glass nodules two galleries away.\", \"outcome\": \"Ilara Embervein follows the dance with a hunter’s poise and decides, after a long pause, that the river has seen stranger purchases, and no audit bell rings against your name. Breg approves; he prefers outcomes that do not rattle windows, and he folds your tariff window into the day’s breathing like a good accountant folding a corner of paper to mark a page. The runners are pleased you did not splash their work with drama, and Yevra slaps the chain twice in a gesture that means the schedule will hold if the wind does. Rukha tucks the Quiet Pour addendum beneath her arm like a loaf that must be walked home warm, and together you ink the signatures with steam still beading the page. Later, a courier from the Veil and Ledger leaves a card with no name and a perfect circle drawn in ash, which may mean you impressed them or merely that you have been measured and filed under ‘useful’.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Bid openly, cloaked in ritual: invoke the Quiet Pour to sanctify the purchase\", \"text\": \"You step into the gallery light and raise your palm so the copper mirrors catch it, and your voice carries the cadence of processions as you name the purchase an offering in motion. You speak of the Quiet Pour, of returning to the river what is owed when the city drinks, and you claim the brine pearls not as profit but as pledge to keep heat flowing like water. You let the bells hear the promise and you let the crowd taste the old story on your words, and even the most cynical clerk knows that denying a ritual costs more than denying a purse. You do not shout; you intone, careful and steady, and you let the Exchange remember it was built on bargains that kept hunger at bay, not on cleverness alone. When the final number leaves your lips, it feels less like a bid and more like a binding, and the terrace listens as if the vents themselves had hummed assent.\", \"outcome\": \"The Emberwatch does not move a muscle, because to interrupt a ritual pledge would crack more than law; it would bruise the pact that keeps brass masks on friendly faces in hard seasons. Breg Tesserin inclines his head, impressed or resigned, and his scribes begin drafting the charter addendum while the ink is still warm with steam. Yevra’s runners agree to the synchronized slots with the oddly tender superstition of workers who have seen too many near-misses not to respect a blessing, and they tie a small knot of thanks onto the chain itself. Rukha signs with a flourish and adds a line that dedicates a portion of the saved tariffs to the Quiet Pour procession, binding mercy to memory in a way even cynics struggle to unpick. Sere Vell watches from a shadow and smiles a smile that says ritual is just another kind of mask, but for today, she lets the city keep this one without asking a price.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M3\"], \"next\": [\"M5\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"currency\", \"description\": \"Salt-scrip grant earmarked for machine lubrication and food carriage fees, stamped under the Price-Bell to legitimize spend on both chains and cupboards.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Crate of brine pearls for heat exchange experiments, glow-certed and river-sung to hold breath where engines and vaults run hot.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Reputation: + with Salt Charter, recorded in knot-ledgers as a facilitator who kept the Exchange’s rhythm without cracking the bell.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"benefit\", \"description\": \"Conditional tariff relief window tied to a future test run of the Iron Cradle, written into a charter addendum and bound to Quiet Pour contributions.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
