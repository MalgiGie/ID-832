The drill square below is a chessboard of slag-black and ash-gray, where hoses coil like sleeping serpents and bucket lines stand ready as if they remember the last time flames tried to write new law across the stone. Vara Keshlin waits with her mask unclipped at her hip and soot caught like constellations in the sweat at her hairline, her posture a bell-hammer held just short of striking. She speaks in the tone of nights that did not end when the sun came up, measuring every word against the weight of bodies she has lifted and lowered through smoke. You have come to ask for the unthinkable luxury of stillness in a city that survives by motion, a pause in the great lift-song so an iron cradle can be proven harmless and a rumor can be reborn as a mandate. To win it, you must become part of their machine and let them become part of yours: run their drills until your arms quiver, thread your wards through their ropes until the sparks tire of hunting, and breathe their smoke through your altered mask until the last cough comes not at all. Beneath neat ledgers and clipped orders, the Citadel hides its own labyrinth—whispers of a mask that writes shadow law and of bells that call help and ruin with the same clear tone—but today the only secret that matters is whether you can convince a garrison built to stop fires that the motion you bring will keep one sleeping under glass from ever waking hungry.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\"Report to Vara Keshlin at the Emberwatch Citadel and request a temporary lift shutdown and corridor clearance mandate.\", \"Assist in a live fire drill, using your ember-thread wards to contain a staged flare on a chain-lift platform.\", \"Demonstrate the Half-Brass Mask’s filter efficacy with the miner’s insert against slag smoke.\", \"Answer a panel of wardens’ questions about crowd control and emergency failsafes for the Iron Cradle.\", \"Receive a stamped permit authorizing a timed test run through the Chainquarter and Underrun docks.\"],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Vara Keshlin\", \"lines\": \"I do not count myths, I count those who breathe at dawn after a bad night, and I prefer their number to remain the same as it was at dusk. You want me to stop the city’s pulse long enough to fit your cradle into its heartbeat, and then you promise you can start the rhythm again without a missed beat or a torn artery. Show me, not with the tongue of a temple, but with hands that hold hoses and with wards that do not flinch when heat snarls. My crews will ask questions the way fire asks questions of rope, and if your answers fray like a poet’s ribbon, I will cut the knot and be done. You will treat my people as more than witnesses to your theory; they will be part of your machine, and if it fails they will not be the gears that shear.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Coilglass\", \"lines\": \"Fear is the first curve in any good chart, Commander, and I have traced it until the ink ran dry and my hands learned to turn the page without smearing the truth. My ember threads are woven to breathe with the platform, to carry wandering sparks along familiar paths until they tire and cool like dogs finally led home. The cradle has failsafes layered like scales: a governor that starves motion when heat spikes, a counterweight brake that bites before momentum lies, and a bell-signal protocol that makes retreat a practiced step rather than a stumble. I did not come to hide behind omens or to make your crews my shield; I came to invite them into the pattern so they can test the seams before any strain goes live. Let me run the drill with you, let me foul my lungs in your smoke and prove the mask is worth its brass, and then judge me by what your eyes and your people say when the hoses hiss and the flare fails to find new rope.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Riven Hask\", \"lines\": \"I have stood on a swaying rung with a coil in one hand and a child under the other, and I have watched good rope turn mean when sparks run hungry, so do not sell me on pretty patterns. When the platform jerks mid-lift and a crate shifts like a bad thought, what bites first—your brake, or the panic in the eyes around you? If you find yourself one voice among many in a gale of shouting, how do you make your bell heard without turning the square into a stampede of fear? Tell me what you do when a warden goes down coughing under the mask and a second reaches to lift them and becomes a third problem. Tell me how you shut it all down and walk us away, and tell me the cost you are willing to pay to do it before my people become arithmetic.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yevra Ashleaf\", \"lines\": \"You say your Half-Brass Mask has a miner’s insert, and I have seen a dozen such promises crack under slag smoke as if they were eggs under boots. How long does your filter hold before the breath turns sweet with poison, and how many breaths does it steal to save the rest? Show me the seals and the reedstone, and tell me how someone with a broken nose and hands like mine refits it in the dark without a mirror or an oracle’s patience. I want to know if it fogs when fear runs hot, and if it does, what you have taught your people to do besides tear it off and die easy. We do not trade lungs for lore here; we trade gear for mornings we can walk to, and I need to believe this mask knows the way.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Maela Scor\", \"lines\": \"Crowds are fire without flame, and I have seen them lick at a rumor until steel softens, so speak to me about how you cool them before they boil. You want corridors cleared, but the Chainquarter snarls when you pull a single link; where do you place your wardens, and what words do they carry besides ‘Move’ when the old and the stubborn decide to lean? Suppose someone shouts that the lifts are cursed and points at your horns because it is easier to hate a shape than a schedule; what speech do you put in my mouth that is more useful than my baton? If a crate goes over a rail and breaks like a drum, how do you keep the sound from summoning a second accident made of feet? Tell me how you plan for the ones who refuse to plan with you, and remember that I am not asking for poetry, only for roads through panic.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jask Lumenwright\", \"lines\": \"I taught this one to listen to heat the way you listen to bells, Vara, and I will not defend them if their weave sings false, but I will mark the notes if they hold. The Iron Cradle is not a prayer but a pulley married to a promise, and promises are your jurisdiction as much as mine. We have omens that speak of motion as medicine, but omens are a poor diet when the house catches; that is why we came to your table with hoses in our hands. Let the drill be the argument and the answers be the grip of the threads and the steadiness of the mask, and if the pattern frays, I will be first to cut it apart with you. But if it holds, hear the simple thing it says: that we can carry heat without letting it run, and that your bells can be the spine of that carrying rather than the last sound before a silence.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Vara Keshlin\", \"lines\": \"You have given me answers that taste of ash and effort rather than incense, and I prefer them that way because they do not sweeten anything I cannot swallow. We will run your drill on Platform Seven, because it is a bastard that wobbles when wagons lie and I like to give new claims the worst cousin at the table. You will take your threads and you will make them walk the flare like a patient dog, and my wardens will try to trip you because panic does not send notices before it arrives. If the mask fogs, you will not tear it off; you will work the reedstone and show my people how lungs live where pride dies. If you pull this off, I stamp your permit in brass and I give you a bell-code that calls my boots faster than a curse, and if you lie to me or hide a corpse behind a hymn, I end your project on a signal and still sleep that night without regret.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"March by the Book\", \"text\": \"You insist on running the drill exactly to Emberwatch specification, asking Vara to walk the checklist aloud so every warden hears the cadence and you can echo it with your own procedures. You keep your ember threads coiled and tidy until the bell, then you deploy them in measured lengths, calling out each anchor and confirming each bite with a warden’s nod before moving. When Maela tests crowd pressure with staged shoves and shouted rumors, you counter with clear countersigns, repeated twice and then again, making your voice part of the drill’s beat rather than a competing clamor. You demonstrate the Half-Brass Mask changeout in darkness by counting finger-lengths and ridges, showing how fear can be taught to move like a practiced hand instead of an animal. When Riven asks for shutdown, you do not argue; you pull the brake with the reverence of a ritual, and let the platform settle as if it had wanted to sit all along.\", \"outcome\": \"The wardens come away with the impression that your machine is another warden in brass and thread, not an exception demanding special attention, and that earns you a conservative kind of trust that does not sing but does hold. Vara stamps the permit while it is still warm from the press, and she assigns two steady veterans to the test window out of professional respect rather than suspicion. The Chainquarter crews grumble less than expected because they saw the checklist honored, and even the most rigid Chainwrights admit that your cadence kept the lift-song in tune. Word travels to the Underrun that you speak ‘watch’ as well as ‘weave’, and the River Covenant’s bellkeeper notes your bell-code without a frown. You gain a small but real reservoir of goodwill with Emberwatch crews, and the Citadel bell will answer your call during the test as promised, with Vara’s name pinned like a weight to the order that moves them.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Overprove the Pattern\", \"text\": \"You decide to stage a larger flare than scheduled to expose any hidden weaknesses, warning the square but not announcing the full measure so the drill tests raw reaction rather than rehearsed comfort. Your threads leap farther and you walk them faster, weaving a net that hums like a low chord as sparks seek paths and meet only patient glass. You swap masks mid-haze with your eyes closed, narrating each ridge and latch as if teaching a class that can only hear, and you call for shutdown at the exact moment panic might have nibbled the edges if you had waited. Maela and Riven curse you in the same breath they admire the timing, and Yevra’s hands shake not from fear but from the release of holding edge too long. Vara watches without blinking until the last ember dies against your ward, and then she blinks once, a slow, deliberate motion that says she counted every risk you took and every one you refused.\", \"outcome\": \"The panel respects your audacity and the way you pulled the brake before adrenaline made a liar of your judgment, but they mark the extra heat in their ledgers as a debt you now owe them in caution. Vara stamps your permit with an additional note that authorizes your corridor but places an extra pair of eyes at each choke point, veterans who will not hesitate to call a halt if the flame of your confidence runs too hot. Among Emberwatch crews, your name tastes like a strong drink: welcome in some throats, resented in others, but undeniable in its burn. The Chainquarter gossips for a day about how the flare looked like an angered drake until it curled up and slept on your thread, and that story buys you clearance in certain alleys and side-lifts where tales matter more than writs. The Citadel bell will answer your call during the test window, but a second bell—short, sharp—will follow if your course strays, a reminder that the leash of trust is long yet very real.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Invoke the Pact in Plain Terms\", \"text\": \"When the questions turn circling, you speak of the Pact of First Heat without incense, shaping it as a contract the Citadel already keeps every time it holds fire in a forge and forbids it from walking the streets. You compare the Iron Cradle to a hose in reverse, not a relic but a civic tool meant to carry dangerous heat where it must go without letting it choose its own path. You talk about the city’s fear of stasis and how every faction fights it with motion—chains, barges, schedules, drills—and you set your work among those motions like a new gear that will take load so others do not shear. You offer to publish your failsafes in the Black Library’s ash-ink, to be notarized under heat-seal so any warden can hold you to your word in daylight, and you name Vara as co-signer so the permit carries both your breath and hers. You end by saying you do not need Emberwatch to believe in dragons, only in brakes, bell-codes, and in the habit of keeping bargains once stamped.\", \"outcome\": \"The panel relaxes by degrees because you do not ask them to kneel at an altar, only to do what they already do with a new tool that fits their hands, and this turns suspicion into a practical calculus. Vara stamps the permit with a small smile she does not show often, because you have just tied your reputation to hers in a way that lets her pull you up or cut you down by the same cord. The Oracle Loom’s name on your tongue does not sour the room because you framed it as ledger and seal, and even the most secular wardens nod at the sense of escrowed responsibility. In the Chainquarter, a few gruff foremen who loathe prophecy admit, grudgingly, that a promise they can audit is a promise they can permit, which smooths your test run’s edges. The Citadel bell will answer your call during the window, and, perhaps more importantly, a handful of wardens will answer your voice without waiting for the bell, because you made the Pact sound like their work rather than someone else’s faith.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M9\"], \"next\": [\"M11\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Permit\", \"description\": \"Emberwatch stamped permit for a timed corridor clearance that authorizes a temporary lift shutdown and guarded passage for the Iron Cradle’s test run.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Equipment\", \"description\": \"Brass-ward patches fitted for chain-lift platforms, tuned to your ember-thread harmonics to help sparks walk away from rope and rest in cooling plates.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Standing improved with Emberwatch crews, who now regard you as a practitioner who trains with their drills rather than a theorist who hides behind omens.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Support\", \"description\": \"Access to the Citadel’s bell-signal during the test window, granting rapid warden response to halt crowds or open corridors as needed.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
