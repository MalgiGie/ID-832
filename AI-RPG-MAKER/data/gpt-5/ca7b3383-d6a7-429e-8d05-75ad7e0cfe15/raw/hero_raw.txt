Copper-threaded black hair is bound in a rigger’s knot, and pale heat-sheen lingers in golden irises. Usually wears a vent-cloak over Loom-woven glassfiber sleeves, fingers stained with ash-ink.\",\n    \"distinctive_signs\": \"Left horn is chipped from a glassfall in the Shatter Mines; a cinder-mark in the shape of a chain link glows faintly along the jaw when standing over warm vents.\"\n  },\n  \"class\": \"MAG\",\n  \"history\": \"Born on the Sunward Ledges to a lampwright family who trimmed lantern-kites for the Glass Sea caravans, Neris grew up reading the city’s moods by the taste of steam and the song of chainwheels. Caught sketching the ripples in a copper basin outside the Oracle Loom, they were taken in as a late acolyte by Jask Lumenwright, who taught them to hear futures in heat-harmonics. When the Loom whispered of an Iron Cradle that must keep an egg in motion or all will cool to ruin, Neris chose the path between factions, courting Chainwrights for engines and the Orphans of Aelmyr for pact-lore. A shatterwight raid in the Mines left Neris with a horn scar and a debt to Tosk Glassbite, while quiet ration deals with Rukha Mossbank kept experiments running when the Salt Charter squeezed prices. Neris now works between the Chainquarter and the Oracle Loom, building portable cradles that circulate heat using scavenged Orin gyres and ember-thread coils. They are tolerated by Emberwatch when drills need augury and despised when omens close lifts. Rumors say Neris has piloted a skiff through a blue-bell night at the Underrun and heard a heartbeat at Aelmyr’s Wound on Coilnight. Each project inches the city toward a choice: honor the Pact fully by setting the egg in motion, or watch the lifelines be taxed into stasis by fear and profit.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ember-thread Spool\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm-sized bobbin of woven glass fibers that hum in warm air; used to map heat currents and anchor minor wards.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Copper Basin Locket\",\n      \"description\": \"Folding scry-basin etched with ripple glyphs; condenses steam into a mirror for Loom-style augury on the move.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ash-Ink Stylus\",\n      \"description\": \"Needle pen filled with ash-ink from Aelmyr’s Wound; writes heat-stable notes on obsidian or vellum.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Feather-Gyre Calibrator\",\n      \"description\": \"Thumb gyre salvaged from the Skybridge ruins; when spun near chains or cradles, it balances micro-shifts in weight.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Vent-Pearl Pair\",\n      \"description\": \"Whisperfen pearls that store two breaths each; used for Underrun work or holding breath during vent surges.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Half-Brass Mask\",\n      \"description\": \"A cut-down Emberwatch respirator, re-fitted with reedstone; filters slag dust and steadies focus in fumes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chainhook Baton\",\n      \"description\": \"Short iron rod with a retractable hook for catching lift-links and defending against alley cutpurses.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 9,\n    \"agility\": 12,\n    \"constitution\": 11,\n    \"intelligence\": 17,\n    \"wisdom\": 14,\n    \"charisma\": 13,\n    \"dexterity\": 13,\n    \"endurance\": 10,\n    \"perception\": 15,\n    \"luck\": 11\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"heat-harmonic interpretation\",\n    \"guild mediation and negotiation\",\n    \"streetwise logistics across city strata\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Jask Lumenwright\": \"Former mentor at the Oracle Loom who taught Neris to weave ember threads; now a cautious ally who fears the Iron Cradle will ignite guild wars.\",\n    \"Tosk Glassbite\": \"Basaltborn rope-saddle miner who dragged Neris out of a shatterwight fog; barters star-crystal slivers for warded tools and watches Neris’s back in the Mines.\",\n    \"Rukha Mossbank\": \"Terrace-Stewards quartermaster and confidante; secures ration chits and smokeherb permits for experiments, and presses Neris to keep the city fed before prophecies.\"\n  },\n  \"ambitions\": \"Assemble a functioning Iron Cradle that circulates pact-heat through motion, then convince Chainwrights to dedicate engine time so the hidden egg will never cool.\",\n  \"flaws\": \"Obsessive when theory aligns with omen, prone to bargaining away favors faster than they can repay, distrustful of static hierarchies, and physically vulnerable to dust-lung in cold, dry winds.\",\n  \"dreams\": \"Recurring dream of steering a cradle-barge through the Singing Gate while stonewhales sing counterweights into place, followed by a soft heartbeat rising through glass.\",\n  \"secrets\": \"Neris traded their clearest memory of their mother’s face to the Bride of Mist for a path during a stormed Coilnight; they also sold a sanitized copy of an Orin gyre log to the Veil and Ledger to fund early cradle parts, and once used the Black Library’s map-song to open a hidden aisle and hum a fragment that still rings in the Chainheart’s sealed sub-level.\"\n}"
