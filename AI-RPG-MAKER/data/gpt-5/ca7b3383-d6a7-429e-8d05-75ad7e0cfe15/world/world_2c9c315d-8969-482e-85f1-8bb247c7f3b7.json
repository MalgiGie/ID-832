    "city": "Skarnhold is a rift-city terraced into the black basalt walls of the Spine Rift, where constant steam-plumes from geothermal vents paint the air in pearly veils. The city is built on three primary strata connected by skyhooks and wind-swayed chain-lifts: the Sunward Ledges (open terraces of soot-dark houses and copper-clad balconies), the Chainquarter (an industrial maze of cable halls, engine cradles, and ore tramways), and the Underrun (cavern harbors along the warm subterranean river called the Ireflow). Skarnhold’s climate is dry and sharp in the wind, but pockets of humid warmth gather over vents, sustaining terraces of moss-fruit, smokeherb, and fungi farms. The population is a braided mix of Riftborn humans, basalt-carving dwarves known locally as the Basaltborn, cinder-marked tieflings of the Cinderline, and itinerant salt-caravaneers who ride the Glass Sea. Skarnhold’s founding myth speaks of the Pact of First Heat: a parley with the wounded ash-dragon Aelmyr, who taught the founders to harness the vents in exchange for sanctuary of a hidden egg. Whether Aelmyr died or only sleeps is debated, but the Pact undergirds law and custom; to break a bargain in Skarnhold is to blow on sleeping coals. The economy depends on geothermal smithing, obsidian and crystal from the Shatter Mines, sun-salt from the Glass Sea of Tesser, and tolls from the Ireflow Underrun. The Chainwrights Consortium monopolizes the skyhooks that knit the city together, while the Salt Charter controls caravans and price-books. Oracles interpret heat-swirls in copper basins at the Oracle Loom, and the Emberwatch enforces order with brass masks and emberbrands. Festivals include Coilnight, when chain-lifts are stopped for blessing and lanterns are hung like molten constellations, and the Quiet Pour, when the Ireflow runs low and citizens carry jugs in procession to offer drops back to the river, begging it to rise. Politics smolder constantly: tariffs at the Underrun pit the River Covenant against the Salt Charter; the Oracle Loom’s counsels provoke resentment among pragmatic guildmasters; the Veil and Ledger tax the city’s shadow economy; and whispers say the Orphans of Aelmyr hunt for the dragon’s egg beneath the Chainquarter. The city’s greatest fear is a resurgent quake or vying claims on its lifelines—the Glass Sea, the Shatter Mines, and the Ventral Aquifer—each owned in practice by a faction that may place its interests above Skarnhold itself.",
