    "description": "At the Salt Parliament Basins, where prismatic pools mirror the sky and law is measured in glimmers of color, a hush moves like tidefoam whenever the wind shifts across the panes. Delegates in salt-stiffened robes circle the terraced pools, and pages with stained fingers hover at the edges like gulls waiting for scraps, their eyes counting drops with the hunger of gamblers. Rumor travels faster than brine through a cracked grate: a basin key is gone, a color may be falsified, and the emergency tariff for new signal mirrors could be decided by a trick of glass instead of the slow truth of water. Mother Rhy Tidesong draws Sere Kallin to the steps cut into the bone verge and speaks low over the pulse of sluices, asking for steady hands and a warrior’s patience amid the perfume of salt and politics. Beneath the stone-and-bone terraces, a warren of drains breathes, and somewhere in that dim anatomy, a hidden room waits with counterfeit jars and a ledger like a blade that names who would tilt the city on the fulcrum of a hue.",

They call it only brine, and they call color a neutral ship to carry will across a vote, but I hear the old hymns warning that every vessel remembers its last storm. Today, Sere, the city holds its breath in glass and salt while the wind paws at our robes like a hungry cat. Walk with me and feel the terraces breathe underfoot, listen for the false echo that does not belong to prayer or to honest arithmetic. If you hear a lie rising from the drains, catch it by the throat before it breaks the surface, and I will bind it with rites so the crowd need never see the splash."

            "lines": "I have tasted enough sewers and floodcuts to tell the difference between a current and a trickle trying to dress itself as a river. If someone is coloring the vote, they are stealing more than law; they are stealing the taste of justice from every mouth that drinks in this city of ribs. Give me a quiet grate, three heartbeats of still water, and my buckler to flash a signal, and I will find where the brine goes when it thinks no one is counting. I will choose who to shame with a steady hand if I must, but if the bones start to sing the panic song, I will not hold my voice behind my teeth. I have carried the weight of one swapped hue already in a different season and paid for it with a name on a stone; I will not let that mistake grow scales and breed a school."

            "lines": "You walk heavy for a hired shield, and your eyes are too quick for a guest, river-soldier. The basins do not favor twitchy hands or private crusades, and the Parliament’s patience grows thin when temple shadows stretch across our pools. If there is a theft, we will resolve it in our own hue, with procedure as old as drought, and it will not flatter you or your priestess if you stir the surface into froth. Do your looking, but keep your discoveries narrow and your steps quieter than the drip between votes, because a riot can grow from a single red glimmer falling where blue should be. Remember that bread and salt hang on calm waters today, and some of us will count that calm before we count your righteousness."

I could tell you which grate yawns when no one watches, and which rung leads to a room where jars wear labels that lie prettier than a market song, if your memory loosens a knot in my ledger. The Parliament thinks glass is clean and prayer is muddy, but both stain the same when spilt, and I would rather we did not drown in either. If you make noise up there, the Wardens will bare teeth and the Bazaar will lose three ladders by sunrise, and all that noise will wash the truth away. Go soft and come back with ink on your hands instead of blood on your boots, and maybe I forget that you once steered a patrol past a ladder I needed."

            "text": "You step into the sunlit ring, lift your saint-glass buckler to send a green flash, and call for stillness while pages freeze and delegates clutch their brine pitchers. You name the missing key, the hidden drain, and the counterfeit jars with a voice that carries like a bell rung in fog. You show the ledger’s edges without opening it wide, letting the threat of names curb the crowd more than the ink itself, and you offer the brine to Mother Rhy for a public rite of cleansing. You invite the Wardens to take positions where teeth may bear but pikes remain sheathed, and you insist the tariff vote pause until the pools are tested against true-color. You gamble that daylight is a caustic strong enough to strip whatever lies were lacquered over this session, trusting that fear can be set back on its heels when given a clear reflection.",
            "outcome": "The terrace holds its breath and then exhales in murmurs that break like gentle surf rather than storm, and the Wardens make a ring whose iron never touches the basins. Mother Rhy sings a rite that tastes of salt and cool stone, pages draw samples, and a simple test reveals two pools were shaded just off by a hair’s width that only a lenswright’s hunger would notice. Yasma Brine narrows her eyes but bows to procedure, and a postponement is voted with reluctant dignity while you hand the counterfeit jars to a sealed Warden coffer. Word of your act runs fast, earning you the favor of the Tidemothers and a chilly respect from Parliament traditionalists, even as a whisper in the Bazaar says you cost certain buyers a tidy speculation. In the ledger’s spine you find coded initials that could belong to a Collegium journeyman with debts, and you feel the city’s pulse slow by one careful beat as the session resets under clearer light."

            "text": "You seal the ledger in wax and cloth, hide the true-color jar under your coat like a quiet oath, and let the vote spill forward with a smile that does not reach your eyes. You trace the players across the basin rims, memorizing who defends haste, who fears delay, and whose fingers tremble when a page stumbles near the drains. You keep the mixing room’s latch unbroken to use again as a doorway into different secrets, and you mark the smugglers rung with a knot only you and one other know. You tell Mother Rhy with your eyes that patience is a kind of courage, and she answers with a hymn hummed at the edge of hearing that tastes of disappointment and trust. You promise yourself a later tide where proof will weigh heavier, perhaps to pry open a forgotten law about pilot vetoes or to force a bargain that keeps the Engine’s rites out of greedy hands.",
            "outcome": "The vote passes by a narrow blend that favors buying signal mirrors under a schedule that smells of the Collegium’s kilns, and cheer rises from one arc of the terraces while another swallows sand-dry curses. Yasma Brine watches you as if counting your ribs, but she says nothing, and that nothing is a promise that costs you sleep. Mother Rhy’s acolytes drift near you in the basins’ shadow and offer quiet protection that feels like both blessing and leash, and they ask no questions you are not ready to answer. In the days that follow, Keth’s people bring you rumors as if feeding a slow fire, and one night a pilot flag left at your door spells in knots the name of a channel only the Ferryman should know. When you finally unseal the ledger before a chosen audience, its ink swings a later vote hard enough to make three factions blink water from their eyes, but by then you have made an enemy who knows the sound of your boot on a drain stair."

            "text": "You slip through the crowd like a tide that does not ripple, pass a folded message to a page who owes Old Marr a favor, and vanish into a service stair that smells of old storms. You meet Marshal Isera Bent-Pike under the jawbone arch where teeth are iron-hard shadows, and you set the jars and ledger on a crate with the care you once gave to wounded comrades. You speak in the clipped cadence of watch reports, laying out the grates, the timing, and the way the drains whisper when a false hue is poured, but you keep your name out of the story when the light angles wrong. You ask for a controlled arrest after the vote, a quiet coil around the culprits that does not spill fear into the basins or hand the Temple a banner to wave. You accept that the Temple will suspect, the Parliament will posture, and the Black Net will sniff for the seam in your plan, but you trust iron discipline to hold the city’s jaw closed around this rot.",
            "outcome": "The Marshal’s eyes crease with old respect and fresh caution, and she sets a Warden cordon in motion that walks with cat feet and speaks in nods, not shouts. The vote proceeds, tense but intact, and only after the last drop settles do the Wardens move, drawing three figures from the drain access with hands bound in eel-skin so they cannot wriggle out on a technicality. The culprits include a basin clerk with debts and a glass-runner with a Collegium seal in his boot lining, and under questioning they give up a paymaster’s sigil that will take time to unmask. Mother Rhy frowns at being cut from the center of the rite but admits the calm was worth the bruise to pride, and Yasma Brine publicly praises Warden professionalism while privately promising an audit that will be sharpened like a harpoon. You gain standing with the Wardens and a quiet nod from Isera that tastes like the first step back toward honor, but you also inherit the cold attention of someone who preferred the noise of scandal to the silence of consequence."
