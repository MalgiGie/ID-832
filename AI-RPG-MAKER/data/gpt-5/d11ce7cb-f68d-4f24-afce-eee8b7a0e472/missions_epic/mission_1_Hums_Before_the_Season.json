    "description": "Fog arrived like an uninvited hymn, rolling over the bone terraces three weeks before the monsoon and smudging the Pilots Lantern until its saint-glass glowed a bruised green. In that false season the Skyhook Chain began to sing, not with storm-fury but with a thin, aching music like a harp strung with rain, each note slipping into the ribs until the city’s teeth ached. Pilots woke gasping with copper on their tongues, swearing they had dreamed of ladders spun from lightning, and in those hours Sere Kallin felt the old red-pulse tremor flutter in her chest like a frightened eel. Her stormglass whistle thrummed without breath, the tone bending whenever the chain’s hum leapt across broken links, and it drew her up the skull steps to the Pilots Lantern where the sea opened like a contracting pupil beneath the tower. Sela Tidecount stood with salt in her hair and fog on her lips, pointing to a wreck no one should have seen: a barge drifting upriver without oars, slipping against the Motherflow as if drawn by a secret current, while a half-rusted scroll tube winked from an iron link of the chain as though the sky itself had tucked a message there. Old rumors rippled anew through the bone halls, that seven chords once broke a siege and can calm the heartstone; now the chain seemed to be plucking them in warning, and every delay felt like tightening a knot around the city’s breath.",

            "lines": "Taste the wind, Sere, and tell me it is honest, because my tongue says it is dressed in lies and borrowed season. The chain is humming like a wet wire strummed by a careless god, and the fog is wearing a coat it has no right to donn before the monsoon. I sent three apprentices up the ladder-links to listen and return with measures, and they came back with eyes like boiled fish and songs they could not stop humming even in their sleep. The Parliament will want to blaze every lantern green and call it safety, but too much light in fog is blindness dressed as courage, and I will not have us steer by panic. We need hands that remember the right knots and a heart stubborn enough to argue with the sky itself, and you have both even if the Engine left you with a tremor and the Wardens left you with a badge on a string instead of a post. Go up there when the pressure sighs and the whistle softens, and bring me what the chain is hoarding before the basins vote our sight to death. Take these fog-waymarks and heed their cadence: long, short, short for safe rung; long, long to warn of echo. If you must shout, count three beats before you answer any voice, even mine, so we know it is us speaking and not the chain learning our names. And hold this truth in your teeth, Sere Kallin: once a chain sings out of season, it has already counted the seconds we can afford to waste."

            "speaker": "Sere Kallin",
            "lines": "If the chain is humming early, it is not only the wind playing rib-bones, Sela; the Engine under our feet has been pacing like a caged beast, and my whistle sang last night without my breath. I have climbed those links with rain stitching my face and barnacle ogres testing my balance, and I have no patience for a fog that thinks it can pass for kin ahead of its time. I will go up when the pressure dips and the Stormglass hum slants low, and I will keep my hands on iron only when the song drops to hush, because noisy iron is a lightning-maker. Keep your lantern pulsing in the fog rhythm we practiced, and if I call, answer on the third beat so I know the chain is not throwing my name back to me like a lure. I will bring down the rusted thing and whatever words are trapped in it, and I will set my buckler against any ogre that thinks our city’s breath is a game. I will not have Wardens scrambling up the links with pikes like antennae to invite a bolt, not unless we must, but I will not keep silence that drowns us either. If there is a wreck riding wrong against the Motherflow, I will shadow it and see if the river has learned a new mouth, or if something hungry is towing secrets upstream. You have my oath on the rope, on the third beat, and on the old knots that Old Marr thumped into my skull with his cane."

            "speaker": "Old Marr",
            "lines": "Hear the hum with the tongue as much as the ear, girl, because taste will turn before sound betrays itself, and copper means the sky has bent its head to listen. When you set your feet to the first link, spit in the sea and let it carry your name outward, so any Ferryman within hearing will know you have already paid some price and are not easy taking; they keep a different ledger than smugglers, but they do keep one. The chain was made to shepherd storms, and it remembers its duty like a faithful dog even with half its spine broken; when lightning comes, it does not come straight, it seeks the eager iron and the tallest pride, and you must be neither. Keep the eel-skin coil loose and the knot-song low, and for love of the ribs do not sing back to the chain unless you are ready to finish the tune, because machines get offended when mortals hum half-remembered godsongs. The wreck going up against the Motherflow is either a lie that learned to float upright or a boat with a helmsman that forgot to breathe; in either case, nets are less use than silence, and your buckler’s glass will speak more to it than your blade will. If Wardens come asking what the Conclave knows, tell them we know enough to keep our pilots alive and our city un-drowned, and not enough to share with anyone who’d publish it in a basin before we can test a knot twice. And if you must choose between telling the teeth or the knots, remember: teeth bite what slips, knots hold what tries to run."

            "lines": "If you manage that climb and bring down a scroll tube, do not crack it until I can look at the seam and listen to it sing; stormglass remembers lightning like a spider remembers flies, and sometimes the glass dreams about the moment of the strike and burns the hands that wake it. The rust will want to be left alone, but where iron ends and glass begins is a border the Collegium spends years learning not to cross by accident, and a wrong pry will turn parchment into smoke and song into wound. I still owe you for plucking me out of a kiln-blast when my hair tried to braid itself with flame, so let me pay in knowledge: if the rumor of seven chords is more than market cant, there could be etched figures or harmonics noted in the tube that can be rendered into lenses, into shapes that can catch a note and hold it. We could turn sound into an instrument, not of conquest but of calming, and set it where the Engine can hear it without needing rites that draw blood from the city’s patience. I warn you though, if the Wardens get to the tube first they will lock it in a molar vault and count crossbows while the city hums itself numb, and if the Parliament gets it they will vote the color of caution until bread goes stale. Bring it to Sela, then let me peek with a pilgrim’s humility and a lenswright’s guilt, and I will swear by fire and kiln that I will not lose you to a singing shard. If stormglass nodules ride that wreck, keep them cool, keep them quiet, and keep them from being jostled together, because glass loves to talk to glass and not all conversations should be held in public."

            "text": "You descend from the chain with rust on your palms and fog in your hair and walk straight through the skull’s jaw to the Crown Gate Citadel, letting the Wardens’ teeth-badges catch the sickly dawn light. You ask for Marshal Isera Bent-Pike and tell her the chain sings out of season, a wreck walks upriver without oars, and a scroll tube whispers from an iron link like bait on a barbed hook. You lay the facts out with the discipline she taught you when the Skyhook sang true, and you do not flinch when her eyes weigh the old badge you still wear on a cord like a wound. You explain the Pilots’ waymarks and the pressure dip that grants a window for safe climbing, and you ask for crossbows to watch the water while you ascend with a Warden rope knotted to your waist. You make it clear that secrecy feeds smugglers and that the city deserves its guard awake, and you accept that once the Wardens know, the Parliament will know soon after, because law travels on the same boats as rumor.",
            "outcome": "Marshal Isera clasps your shoulder with a grip like an oarlock and commits a squad to the Pilots Lantern, posting watch on the chain’s lower links and setting a skiff to shadow the drifting wreck with disciplined silence. The climb is safer with steel and discipline at your back, yet slower; every rung is measured, every gust is logged, and when you free the rusted tube it is caged in canvas and cataloged as evidence. Jaxin is held at a polite distance until an official scribe can list the grooves on the cap, and the ember of curiosity in his eyes has to bank under Warden protocol. Word leaks through a bribed sergeant to the Black Net—because coin listens faster than orders—and Keth of the Nets sniffs around the ribsward ladders but finds only Warden pikes and patient stares. The Parliament congratulates itself with a hue of watery caution and takes a little credit for your work during their next basin session, but Sela Tidecount hides a smile when she hands you pilot waymarks anyway, calling it a necessary compromise that kept her apprentices from boiling their eyes twice. You gain standing with the Wardens, even if some pilots grumble that you have given their knots to teeth; your choice brands you as one who will call the city to arms before the fog can lie a second time."

            "text": "You kneel at the Lantern’s base and swear the fog oath with Sela’s palm on your crown, tasting salt and copper while Old Marr hums the low note that means trust bound with rope. You fix the lantern’s pulse to the quiet cadence that only pilots read and you climb when the pressure droops, moving in time with a music you do not sing and will not let sing through you. You free the rusted tube with slow patience, oiling the seam with river spit and coil-sweat, and you cradle it against your saint-glass buckler as if it is a sleeping child that might wake crying lightning. You track the upriver wreck from eel-shadow and bone-ladder, using coded flag flickers and a single flash of buckler light to speak with a skiff that only the Conclave knows to watch, and you slip aboard the drifting hull in a pocket of fog so quiet your boots forget how to creak. You hold your breath while stormglass nodules whisper to one another like cousins at a wake, and you wrap each in reed and resin so they cannot conspire, then you bring all of it to Sela’s table with fog still clinging to your sleeves.",
            "outcome": "The Pilots Conclave closes ranks around you, and Sela’s laugh is tired but grateful as she sets down mugs that steam like prayers, telling you the knots held and the teeth never saw a strand of it. Old Marr thumps his cane and names you river-stubborn in front of the apprentices, who stare at the scroll tube as if it might decide what kind of pilots they will become. Jaxin is summoned by a wink and a whistle rather than a summons writ in Warden ink, and he studies the cap and seam by lantern-soft without waking any song, muttering shapes and harmonics like a benediction only glass can hear. The Wardens notice the quiet bustle around the Lantern’s base and ask polite questions you answer with polite fog, and though there is a flash of suspicion in Isera’s eye, she lets it die against the gratitude she remembers you earning in storms. Keth of the Nets hears only that something valuable rode the chain and failed to land in his ledger; he prowls the Ribsward Bazaar like a shark denied its usual scent, but your route is nets within nets and he catches only air. You gain deep goodwill with the Conclave and the waymarks are yours to keep, etched in a hand that will open to you in any fog; the price is a colder nod from certain Wardens and the knowledge that if the chain hums louder, you will be expected to climb again without waiting for teeth to bare first."

            "text": "You set the Lantern to a deceptive rhythm—green-long, green-short, green-long—that reads as shoals to any chart but tells pilots to wait, and you scatter a handful of prism salt into the basin wind so the fog glitters just enough to look treacherous. You shadow the upriver wreck through the Nine Mouths with your buckler hooded, letting the ferries pass like ghosts and tasting the copper of the chain on your tongue to time your breath with its hum. You test the scroll tube not by opening it but by touching it with the edge of your stormglass whistle and listening for sympathetic pain, learning where the seam will forgive you when you finally turn it. You coax a few stormglass nodules into silence by bedding them apart in reeds and singing the lowest note Old Marr taught you, and you mark on bone how the wreck moves against the Motherflow as though a tenth mouth is pulling from somewhere uncharted. You return before dawn stains the ribs and set the Lantern’s heartbeat back to honest, meeting Sela’s steady stare with pockets full of observations and a night’s worth of risks that will never be written into a Parliament ledger.",
            "outcome": "Sela scolds you for the lie of the lantern, then thanks you for the truth you bought with it, and the two sentiments knot together into something like respect that can weather another season. Your notes reveal a pattern in the chain’s hum that steps through five tones and pauses twice, and Jaxin all but trembles to translate those pauses into shapes that lenses could catch and hold for the Engine to hear. The Wardens catch a whisper that the Lantern’s rhythm misled a late barge, and Marshal Isera delivers a warning that tastes like old disappointment: do not toy with the city’s heartbeat again without calling the teeth to hear it. Keth prowls and nearly stumbles onto your reed-wrapped nodules, but a stray gust flips a market awning into his path and he swears at weather instead of at you, never knowing how narrow his near-claim was. You keep the discovery primarily within the Pilots for now, reporting to Sela with your added observations and earning her promise to stand with you when the question of Wardens or knots is finally forced in public. The price of your stall is a sharper eye from the Wardens and a murmur in the Parliament that the Lantern mis-signaled, but the gain is knowledge enough to make any later choice wiser and a stronger hand when asking for the waymarks that thread the low fog under the Skyhook."
