    "description": "Within the sixth and seventh vertebrae where shelf-ribs cradle the city's memory, the Ossuary Archive keeps a chamber the river has never truly left, a drowned reading room lit by jars of glow fungus that paint the damp with patient stars. Books swell with silt and breath, and when a south wind leans through the bones, their slick pages whisper the language of currents as if the flood itself had learned to read. Scribe Nalea Chalkfinger, keeper of the Bone Index and listener to the Archive's nocturnal breath, has traced a hidden cadence in those murmurs, a song-thread that entwines wind-harp notes from the Cairn of the Hollow King with the forbidden pulse-measures the Bonewright Covenant locks beneath seal. She cannot cross those seals without a riot of law and ritual, but she can bid Sere Kallin to go where ink remembers drowning: into the drowned room to find an eel-skin codex inked in bone dust, its spine humming with a south-born tone and its chalk-scent sharp enough to cut through mildew and fear. If brought to light and matched against a storm-torn scroll salvaged from a rusted Skyhook link, the codex may turn rumor into a map of chords, a lattice of measures by which the city's leviathan heart might be soothed rather than shackled.",

        "Speak with Nalea Chalkfinger at the Ossuary Archive about wind-harp notation and pulse measures, and hear why songs may be laws the water obeys.",
        "Enter the drowned reading room and identify the eel-skin codex by its chalk-scent and humming spine amid the whispering silt-wet shelves.",
        "Calm the whispering books by reading a bone-script lullaby provided by Nalea until their pages lie without tugging at your breath.",
        "Return the codex without letting its damp ink stain reveal names that should not yet be spoken, keeping secrets sleeping until they can be safely sung."

            "lines": "I copy our laws in bone dust so they float when floods come and men forget them, and I have come to suspect that songs are laws as well, only gentler in the throat and sharper in the dark. At night the Archive inhales and exhales, and the drowned room breathes with it; the books there are no longer mute things but a chorus that learned the flavor of current and the grammar of silt. In their whispers I have found a measure, a cadence that leans south when the wind does, and it matches the figures of the Heartward Engine's pulse you dared carry to me as if those bones and these pages share a secret language. The Bonewrights keep their vault sealed with oaths and brass, and I will not crack it, yet truth finds its own channel and I believe it has pooled in a single eel-skin codex that hums when chalk dust settles. Fetch it for me, Sere Kallin, and perhaps we can teach Marrowgate to sing itself back to sleep instead of rattling its ribs with fear."

            "speaker": "Holl Riverborn",
            "lines": "Wet your fingers with clean brine before you touch anything in there, and let the salt remember what the river forgets, because dry hands turn pages cruelly and the room hates cruelty. It is like handling the soft side of a wave—pliant at first, then clutching if you let panic into your lungs—and the books will pull at your breath as a drowning cousin might pull at your wrist. If they whisper names to you, you must not answer, for even kindness can be a snare when a book believes you are its rightful reader and binds you to a promise made by someone long drowned. Keep the lullaby steady and low, like a skiffman's song before dawn, because the words are carved to ease paper and muscle at once and the room listens more to tone than to sense. If you feel iron in your pockets grow heavy or your thoughts taste of rust, step back and swallow river air, for the Tidemothers teach that patience is the only hook that never tears."

            "speaker": "Sere Kallin",
            "lines": "I have been wrapped in worse whispers than jealous paper and pulled free of deeper waters than these shelves can conjure, but I will not pretend the room does not have teeth of its own. Show me the lullaby and I will put it in my chest until my ribs remember the rhythm without my tongue, because a steady body steadies the world around it. If the notes from the wind-harps and the pulse from the Engine truly echo one another, then perhaps there is more to this than accidents and frightened guilds, and the city's bones are trying to speak through any mouth they can find. I will listen for the hum of the codex as for a pilot's lantern in fog, and I will keep my palms salted and my eyes soft so the pages do not bristle. And if the room presses names against me like a crowd at Ribsward dusk, I will hold my breath like a Warden on the chain and pass through without letting even my shadow promise what my voice cannot pay."

            "title": "Sing the bone-script lullaby exactly as taught",
            "text": "You slow your step until your boots and breath agree, and you plant the lullaby in your chest the way Old Marr taught you to carry a knot song—low, even, and more about patience than pitch. You wet your fingers with clean brine, let the salt slick your touch, and treat each page of air as if it is a wounded thing that will mend if not hurried. The room leans in with the hush of a sleeping quay, and the glow fungus seems to dim as if listening for the next line, and you give it that line without pride. When the whispers send you a name, you do not answer; you place the lullaby between your ear and the syllables like a shield and the syllables fall to the floor and become only water. In that gentled space you follow the chalk-scent like a river fox noses for light fish, and you find the eel-skin codex humming lightly as though it is remembering a sun it never saw.",
            "outcome": "The drowned room releases you as a tide releases a moored skiff, reluctant but not vindictive, and the pages that brushed your wrists lie flat as leaves after rain. The eel-skin codex rests in your Saint-Glass Buckler without smearing, and no damp ink stains rise to betray the names sleeping in its margins, which pleases Holl and loosens Nalea's tight shoulders into something like a smile. Back in the Archive hall, monks step around you the way sand steps around a still pool, and their nods carry the weight of respect rather than the itch of gossip. Nalea reads the first measures aloud under her breath, and you watch her mouth shape chords that ring faintly in your Stormglass Whistle as if the chain far north has remembered an old harmony. The success earns you the promised quiet niche among the ribs, and word passes softly that Sere Kallin knows how to carry a song without bruising it, which will matter when councils grow loud and forget the pitch of mercy."

            "text": "You trust the shard’s tune more than your throat and lift the Stormglass Whistle to your lips, remembering the way the Skyhook Chain once sang in a blue-black squall. The first note quivers, a hair too bright, and the drowned shelves shiver like a fish startled in a net, so you ease your shoulders and tune down until the whistle’s voice lies where the room breathes. The harmonies fold like sailcloth in a tame wind, and you feel pressure loosen behind your eyes as if a storm has decided, for now, to break out at sea instead of over your head. The whispers try to ride the whistle’s current, but you keep your breath steady and your mind blank of names, and you steer the pitch the way you would a skiff between hidden bars. When the hum and your note meet, the codex all but rises to your hand, as if it has waited for metal-born thunder to grant it permission to move.",
            "outcome": "The codex comes easy, but a single bead of damp ink sweats from its spine and crawls down your thumb like a curious eel before you wipe it on clean cloth, and for a heartbeat you swear it spelled the first letter of a councilor's name. Nalea frowns but does not scold, because the measures inside are crystalline and the mapping to the Skyhook scroll lines like teeth in a comb, yet she warns that instruments can tempt you to force a river that would have flowed if you had only waited. The monks murmur about devices in sacred places, and a Tidemother novice leaves a reed charm at the door of the drowned room as if to soothe what you have stirred, which you accept without protest. Your success comes with a shadow: the Wardens’ informants in the Archive whisper that your whistle was heard in a place iron should not sing, and Marshal Isera's memory of your resignation itches like an old bruise. Even so, the niche is granted and the respect is given, if more cautious, and the codex’s clarity speeds Nalea's work enough that your next steps arrive sooner than they otherwise might have."

            "title": "Bargain with the whispers and pay with a secret name",
            "text": "You lower your head and let the room’s susurrus fill the spaces behind your eyes until the whispers sound like a council speaking through water, then you answer not with your voice but with a memory the Ferryman once took the shape of—a patient debt that knows your gait. The pages tremble at the taste of a name unsaid, an oath-shaped syllable you carry like a hot coal, and they lean in as if the codex itself were a mouth at your ear. You promise no allegiance and make no vow, but you offer a barter: the shape of a name you will never speak aloud as long as the book gives you what you came for, and the room seems to understand the weight of silence as a proper coin. The lullaby becomes the counterpoint to this bargain, and you sing it not to calm the books but to remind yourself that rivers need banks as much as channels. When the deal lands, the codex hums like a satisfied catfish and slides toward you, and something else slides with it, a thin stitched leaf tucked into the binding like a final breath held too long.",
            "outcome": "You leave with the eel-skin codex and an extra page that smells faintly of rusted chain and distant thunder, and Nalea recognizes at once that the insert is a concordance key no one expected to exist. She reads it with hands that tremble and tells you, quietly and without ceremony, that this may save a year of trial and two of argument, but her eyes search yours because she hears in your song the sound of a bargain kept off the books. Holl Riverborn sets a dish of salt by the niche he grants you and tells you to dip your fingers each time you sit, a ritual against bargains that ride inside breath, and you accept because a small rite is cheaper than a name. Word moves as water moves, and somewhere in the Ribsward Bazaar a broker with a smile like a cut wonders why a codex would purr when a certain Warden's name passes in a back-room joke, though no one can say where the rumor began. The city has more of you now than it did before, but in return you have more of its hidden music, and the chords that might soothe the heartstone come into focus like ribs through clear water, sharp enough to steer by if you dare."
