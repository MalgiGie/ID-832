    "description": "Marrowgate took a long breath after the chords were plucked, and for a handful of tides the bones felt steady underfoot. The Heartward Engine purred like a soothed beast, its red veins easing their frantic blink, but fissures webbed through old conduits and the hairline cracks in civic trust shone like stress lines in saint-glass. The Salt Parliament counted basins and debts with wet fingers, the Ember Collegium polished lenses for leverage, the Bonewright Covenant guarded schematics like children, and the Tidemothers traced hymns across the water, promising the heart would sleep if only the city remembered how to bow. Smugglers of the Black Net slipped between ribs with the ease of eels, dragging favors behind them like hooks you only see when they’re inside your skin. Marshal Isera Bent-Pike sent for Sere Kallin to the Crown Gate Citadel, where the city’s skull looks out upon the Inner Shard Sea and the Pilots’ Lantern blinks its green eye; there, beneath teeth carved into murder-holes, she demanded a table be built and the proud be made to sit.",
    "objectives": [
        "Convene representatives of the Bonewright Covenant, Temple of the Tidemothers, River Pilots Conclave, and Ember Collegium at the Crown Gate, inviting each with language that neither flatters nor threatens but leaves no doubt attendance is required.",
        "Broker terms for a rotating stewardship circle over the Heartward Engine with real checks and limits, so no single hand can push a lever without another hand present to steady or stop it.",
        "Decide whether to expose Keth’s past plot and cut the Black Net from influence entirely, or bind the Syndicate to enforceable oaths that drag them into the city’s light where vows can sting if broken.",
        "Choose what to do with the Ferryman’s remaining favor and whether to spend that moonless coin to seal the accord so that words sink like anchors instead of drifting like nets."

Sit them down and make each of them give up the one thing they swore to die clutching, because only then will we know what they truly value and what they will not betray at the first whiff of storm. If they walk away angry and alive, we have done well, because anger burns off and leaves a hard core we can shape into duty. If they walk away smiling, check your pockets and then check the foundations, because a smile at a council table is often a mask worn by a thief. This city does not need comfort; it needs a spine, and spines are grown from pain learned and shared. I will put Wardens on the doors and a ledger on the table, but you must be the hand that turns the pages and the voice that will not tremble when the ribs begin to sing again."

We mend what we break, and that must be the first law, written in bone-script and sung at the basins until children can speak it in their sleep. If the stormglass singers want to help, let them bring their lenses and stand with us when the pulse flutters, and let their glass cut only fog, not law. If the river priests want to bless our work, let them lay wet hands upon the pistons and hear what we hear, the soft mutter that means the city still floats by grace more than craft. But when the rhythm quickens, we answer to the beat itself, not to coin or scripture, because both will spend us dry if we let them. Give me a circle of stewards, two signatures to every turn of a valve, and a bell that calls any guild to account when their pride echoes louder than the Engine’s hum."

            "lines": "I will lay my hands on the heart and promise to keep it sleeping, because I have dreamed the day it wakes and seen the water stand up like a mother who has been ignored too long. I ask only that no one changes the water’s name without asking the water first, for things have names for reasons that predate our towers and our scarred hands. Write our humility into your accord so our grandchildren can remember we once knew how to bow, not just how to build and bargain, and let that humility be a law that cannot be bought out of season. I will bless any tool that keeps the city afloat, and I will break any tool that calls itself a god, even if its edge is made of light and its temper is perfect, because the deep does not bargain with perfect edges. Bind the circle with oaths that taste of brine and ash, oaths that sting when spoken falsely and soothe when spoken true, and I will pour my voice into them until the ribs themselves know the tune. If you must deal with shadows, drag them into the shallows and make them speak, for even eels must surface to breathe when we thin the water with salt."

Or you can bind me with a vow and my people will tug the net the way you need when floods come at night, because even a smuggler knows when a city must be kept above water to keep coin from sinking. I offer silence at the right times and information at the right price, and I have learned the faces of those who pretend not to buy what they most crave. Spit me out and watch what else you swallow when you are not looking, because you will still need hands in the places Wardens cannot fit and eyes in the fog no lantern can cut. Give me one rung on the ladder and I will show you which steps are rotten, which ropes are frayed, and which gulls peck the granaries with blesséd beaks; tear up the ladder and you will fall with the first man who climbs. Bind me publicly and I will bleed publicly if I cheat; cut me loose and I will only bleed you in private, which costs you more and teaches you less."

I will not let any one of you put a hand on the Engine that does not come paired with another hand to check it, and if you find that insulting then you have not yet learned to love the city more than your guild. We share the watch, and we share the weight, and we count what the weight does to us so we can forgive each other before cracks become chasms. If any of you choose a shortcut that makes the ribs sing in fear, I will be there with a rope and a pike to pull you back or pin you down, and I will not apologize for bruises that keep us breathing. I have one favor left from a boat that leaves no wake, and I would spend it to anchor these words if mortal rope will not hold, but I would rather tie this accord with hands and vows we can see. Speak plainly now, bleed a little now, and we will not drown later to the sound of our own polite lies."

            "text": "Sere drafts an accord that requires two guilds to approve any adjustment to the Heartward Engine and four signatories to authorize emergency measures, with an ironclad audit by the Wardens after every pulse. She names it the Four-Hands Accord and writes into it a rule of repair: if a faction’s action causes harm, that faction must lead the mending with resources, labor, and public apology under the basins. She adds a Pilots’ Veto during declared storms, invoking an old law the Ossuary Archive once whispered, to prevent hasty hands from turning valves when channels are wild. She insists that all instruments touching the Engine be cataloged under joint custody and that all rites be witnessed by a lay notary so that scripture and schematic cannot contradict in secret. Finally, she demands a public bell, the Rib-Song, rung when the accord is invoked so citizens know who bears duty that day and who must answer for it the next. The proposal is stern, visible, and built to be heavy enough that no one person can carry it alone, which is precisely why it might endure.",
            "outcome": "Covenant, Temple, Pilots, and Collegium squabble like gulls in a storm, but the Wardens’ presence and Isera’s stone gaze keep them in the room long enough for signatures to dry. Caur signs first, grumbling about levers, and Rhy presses a wet thumbprint over his name, murmuring a blessing that smells faintly of kelp and smoke; Sela Tidecount adds the Pilots’ thread-twist mark, and Mistress Ashka’s deputy, cautious Pell, scratches the Collegium sigil with a shard of stormglass. The Wardens hang the Rib-Song bell in the Crown Gate arch, and the first time it tolls, citizens stop and look up instead of running, because now duty has a name and a turn. There is grumbling in markets about delays and in kiln-rows about too many witnesses, but the Engine’s hum stays even and the city sleeps a little easier, if not softer. Sere’s name appears in the margins of the accord as Captain-Provisional, charged with mustering the four hands, and Isera hands her a skiff ledger with a look that means don’t you dare drown."

            "text": "Sere stands before the basin families and reveals Keth’s quiet plot to tilt a hue in the Parliament, admitting her own role in swapping a color on a night when panic and debt braided her hands. She names rung ladders and old routes under the Crown Gate palate, and she lays a ledger on the salt tile that shows how many honest loaves were bought with crooked coin. She speaks not with hatred but with a riverwoman’s practicality: the city cannot be steered by hands that hide in its pockets. She offers Keth a chance to stand, name his debts, and leave the table, promising no knife in the back if he goes now and no hand to catch him if he falls later. The chamber chills as the basins’ prismatic hues seem to pale, and when the speech ends there is no applause, only the hiss of wind through net-windbreaks and the long memory of people who do not forget humiliation.",
            "outcome": "Keth’s smile sours like bad brine, and for a moment he looks lighter, as if a mask has fallen and he is only a tired man with expensive shoes on a slick rib. Then he bows, very shallowly, and leaves without taking the rung paths Sere expected, because a clever eel finds a new root when the old one is salted. The Black Net snarls in the alleys, cutting three ladders and vanishing two informants into reed fogs, and the Wardens bleed time and men to keep market blood off the bones. But Parliament trust in Sere rises, and Isera’s patrols find doors opening easier when they knock; the Accord moves forward without shadow signatures and the Rib-Song rings cleaner for a season. Sere sleeps badly, because the river does not forget a name freely given to the Ferryman and a Syndicate does not forget a public stripping, but her skiff carries a straighter wake and that counts for something."

            "text": "Sere chooses a narrower channel and hauls Keth into the shallows under witness, forcing him to kneel at a Tidemother font while Rhy inks a vow into his palm with salt and ash. She names the terms in a voice that carries: the Black Net will inform on contraband that threatens the Engine, abstain from sabotaging guild works, and accept sanction in public if a single oath is broken. In return, the city will neither hound their starving nor torch their hidden moorings when the moon is thin, acknowledging that sometimes food must cross in unofficial baskets to keep peace. She requires Keth to pledge a name he loves to the Ferryman as collateral, the kind of name a person does not say lightly, and the stone token in Sere’s pocket turns colder as if listening. It is not mercy; it is management, and her eyes warn everyone present that she will cut the rope the moment it bites wrong.",
            "outcome": "Rhy’s chant winds through bone rafters, and when Keth repeats the words his voice grates like rope across a splinter, but the vow takes, binding him to the city in a fashion he has always avoided. The Black Net bristles but does not break, and its brokers begin to separate contraband that merely feeds bellies from contraband that feeds fires, quietly slipping warnings to Sere’s skiff when red crates move in the night. Parliament hawks call it weakness until a Wardens’ patrol catches a crate of false basin seals thanks to a tip that Keth could have sold for gold; then they call it prudence and pretend they always wanted it. The Accord gains a shadow appendix, sealed under Tidemother rites, listing penalties that taste like brine when spoken and sting like glass when lied about. Sere keeps a hand on her pike and the other on the bell rope, but for the first time since she took Keth’s resin for her mother’s brace, the debt between them feels like a knot that might hold instead of a noose."

            "text": "Sere walks alone to the Pilots’ Lantern at fog-tide and lets the Ferryman’s token drink the night, calling for the skiff that leaves no ripple and answers questions for the price of a name. She offers her remaining favor to seal the Accord so that any who break it will find their own signatures dragging them down like anchors in their dreams, and any who keep it will find shallow waters when storms rise. The Ferryman listens without blinking, and the green light in the Lantern seems to hold its breath, as if glass could fear. He asks for something not paid in coin: the Accord must carry a true name that will be spoken at every basin vote and carved into a rib, a name that belongs to Sere because burdens are lighter when someone claims them. Sere agrees, though the agreement tastes like copper on her tongue, and the skiff melts back into fog like a lesson you can’t quite teach but will never forget.",
            "outcome": "When the accord is signed beneath the Crown Gate, the words feel heavier, as if ink has density; those who speak them flinch and then straighten, the way a person does when a blade passes close and leaves no cut. In the weeks that follow, a Collegium scribe wakes choking on the sound of a bell after attempting to bypass a witness clause, and a Pilot’s apprentice finds a clear channel through a sudden fog when she remembers to recite the vow aloud. The city whispers that the Four-Hands Accord has a shadow twin in the dark water, a promise that rows beside it and scares gulls off baited lines; some fear it, some cherish it, but all respect it. Sere’s name rides the ribs now, carved small under the bell bracket, and every time the Rib-Song tolls she feels the weight settle on her shoulders like an honest cloak. The Ferryman’s token grows warm once, then cold again, and Sere understands that some debts are paid not in silver or salt but in the quiet knowledge that the city did not drown tonight."
