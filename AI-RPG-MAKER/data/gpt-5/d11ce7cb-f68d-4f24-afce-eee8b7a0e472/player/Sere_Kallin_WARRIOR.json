        "description": "Broad-shouldered delta fighter with sun-browned skin and river-callused hands, hair braided with pilot knots and red thread from the terraces, eyes the color of shallow silt-green water.",
        "distinctive_signs": "Bonebrace scars along the left shoulder and ribs, a chipped tooth-badge from the Wardens worn as a pendant, faint glass-spark flecks in the right iris from a kiln flash."

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Born on stilts between reeds in the Nine Mouths, Sere learned currents and knots at the Pilots Lantern before enlisting with the Wardens of the Crown Gate. She held the Skyhook watch during monsoons and fought barnacle ogres off the low links, then escorted basin tallies through the Ribsward Bazaar where she first crossed paths with Keth of the Nets. During the red tide thirteen years ago she was a raw recruit ferrying panicked families when the Heartward Engine flared; the pulse left her with a tremor and a knack for sensing pressure changes that engineers call bad luck and Tidemothers call listening. Years later, needing resin and a fast brace for her mother’s shattered arm, she took Keth’s quiet help and paid by steering a Warden sweep away from a rung ladder; when the ledger of favors grew teeth, she resigned her post under Marshal Isera Bent-Pike rather than drag her patrol into scandal. Since then Sere has worked as a hired shield on bone ladders and canal runs, guiding Ember Collegium couriers like Jaxin Brail past smugglers and storms, and venturing into the Gloomroot with Vara Rootlight to fetch glow fungus for the Ossuary Archive. She knows the hum of the Engine, the songs of the wind-harps from the Cairn of the Hollow King, and the taste of fog that means the Ferryman’s routes are close; now she walks the ribs trying to repay debts without selling her oath, and to keep the leviathan sleeping without letting any one guild hold the city by its throat.",

    "secrets": "Sere once swapped a basin hue at the Salt Parliament on Keth’s orders to tilt a vote, then destroyed the proof; she paid the Ferryman Without Wake with the name of a corrupt Warden to learn a ghost route during a fog riot; and she carries a memorized sequence of three ribs to strike that could open a hidden water gate beneath the Heartward Engine."
