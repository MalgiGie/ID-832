    "description": "In the Ossuary Archive, a reading room lit by glow fungus keeps books too sodden for fire or sun. They whisper when handled, their pages slick with the memory of floods, and Scribe Nalea Chalkfinger has traced a pattern through the whispers that feels like song. The wind-harp notes recorded from the Cairn of the Hollow King decades ago echo the heart-pulse data the Bonewrights keep under seal. Nalea cannot reach that vault, but she can send Sere into the drowned room to fetch a codex bound in eel-skin and inked with bone dust that holds the missing measures. The codex may make sense of the scroll from the Skyhook Chain and turn rumor into a map of chords.",

The drowned room remembers floods, and the books have learned to talk to one another about the taste of the river. There is a codex that hums when the wind blows from the south, and I hear in that hum a measure that matches the Engine pulse you brought me in figures. Fetch it, and perhaps we can teach the city to hum itself back to sleep."

            "text": "You will want to wet your fingers with clean brine before you touch anything in there. It is like handling the soft side of a wave, and the books can pull on your breath if you let them. If they whisper names to you, do not answer back. Even a kind book can tangle you in a promise if it thinks you are its reader."

If these notes can speak to the chain and to the heart at once, then perhaps all of this noise is not madness after all. Maybe it is a choir tuning itself before a storm."
