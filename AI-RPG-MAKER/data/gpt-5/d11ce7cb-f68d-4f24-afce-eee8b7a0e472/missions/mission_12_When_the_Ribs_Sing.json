    "description": "The city exhaled, but it is not done. After the chords, the Heartward Engine thrums like a contented cat, yet fractures spider through old conduits and rivalries crack where they were only dented. The Black Net still holds debts, the Parliament still wants leverage, the Collegium still wants more glass, and the Tidemothers still want their rites respected. Marshal Isera Bent-Pike calls Sere to the Crown Gate Citadel to decide what comes next. An accord must be hammered between Bonewrights, Tidemothers, Pilots, and Collegium to share stewardship of the Engine. Keth of the Nets wants a seat at the shadows of that table. The Ferryman’s token is cold in Sere’s palm, and the city listens for what voice will speak its future.",

        "Convene representatives of the Bonewright Covenant, Temple of the Tidemothers, River Pilots Conclave, and Ember Collegium at the Crown Gate.",

        "Decide whether to expose Keth’s past plot and cut the Black Net from influence, or bind them to oaths that can be enforced.",
        "Choose what to do with the Ferryman’s remaining favor and whether to use it to seal the accord."
