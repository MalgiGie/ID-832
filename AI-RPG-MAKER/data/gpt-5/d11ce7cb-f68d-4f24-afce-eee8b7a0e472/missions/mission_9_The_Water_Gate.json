    "description": "The cracked conduit near the Heartward Engine is more than a flaw; it is a throat that can open if struck in the right order. Caur Spinekeeper brings Sere into the sternum chambers where bone pistons pump like tired fists and red veins of crystal throb beneath latticed grates. The plan is to strike three ribs in the learned sequence and open a water gate for long enough to see the heart chamber and take a safe measure. But the Black Net has learned of the attempt, and Keth of the Nets has sent quiet hands to co-opt the opening. The chamber’s air tastes like old blood and prayers half-swallowed.",

        "Guard Caur Spinekeeper and Rhy Tidesong while they prepare the Engine rites.",

        "Confront Keth’s operatives and decide whether to drive them off, bargain, or use them.",
        "Secure a clean pulse measure from the heart chamber and close the gate on time."

Strike where I show you and not a breath to either side. If the gate opens and the heart speaks, do not try to answer it. It does not know what a city is. It only knows its own sleep."

If we must choose between a neat measure and a quiet pulse, we choose the quiet no matter what the Collegium says they can build from neatness. A tide can drown in tidy buckets. We are here to let it breathe."

Let the opening be wide enough for two favors to pass through and we all go home dry. Or throw me out and watch the door remember it can slam."
