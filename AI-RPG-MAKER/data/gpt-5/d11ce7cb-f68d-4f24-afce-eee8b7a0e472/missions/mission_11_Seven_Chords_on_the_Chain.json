    "description": "It is time to pluck the sky. The Skyhook Chain glows along dead links as stormheads gather out of season. The eel-skin codex, the stormglass whistle, and the heart pulse measure together point to a sequence: seven chords, in order, at precise distances along the chain, while the Engine’s water gate is open to listen. Rhy Tidesong asks Sere to lead the climb with Sela Tidecount reading wind, Jaxin Brail tending stormglass, and Vara Rootlight singing the eel-chant to calm the waves below. The city looks like a wet lantern from that height. The heartstone’s red beat is a drum underfoot, and lightning is eager to hear a new song.",
    "objectives": [
        "Coordinate with Sela Tidecount, Jaxin Brail, and Vara Rootlight to time the climb and the gate opening.",
        "Pluck the seven chords at their marked links in the correct sequence without being knocked free by wind or lightning.",
        "Signal the Heartward Engine team to close the gate at the final note and record the pulse settling.",
        "Survive the backwash of power and see whether the city’s bones stop singing."

Roll your shoulder into them and let them think you are turning aside when really you are climbing. If you hear me curse, it is a good sign; it means I still have breath."

If I tell you to wait one heartbeat before the next note, trust that my fear is doing math faster than my courage. If this works, we will not hear victory. We will hear the absence of panic. That will be our applause."
