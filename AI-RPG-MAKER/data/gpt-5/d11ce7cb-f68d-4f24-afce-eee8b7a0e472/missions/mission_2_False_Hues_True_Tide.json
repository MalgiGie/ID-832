    "description": "The Salt Parliament prepares to vote on emergency tariffs to pay for new signal mirrors, but a basin key has gone missing and a whisper runs that someone plans to discolor the brine to skew the hue count. Mother Rhy brings Sere to the terraced basins, where delegates murmur among prismatic pools and a hush ripples through the crowd each time the light shifts. The Tidemothers fear that a false hue could justify seizing ritual authority from them and handing it to glassmakers who claim science is cleaner than prayer. Under the basins lies a warren of drains, the very veins of the city, and somewhere below a hidden room waits with jars of counterfeit color and a ledger that names an architect of the crime.",

        "Secure the counterfeit brine jars and the ledger without letting the crowd see you dragging wet crimes into sunlight.",
        "Choose whether to reveal the plot immediately, or hold the proof to leverage a later vote."

They will say this is only brine, that color is a neutral ship to carry will across a vote. But they have forgotten that a city is a bowl of thirsts and that truth is a tide. Walk with me and listen to the basins breathe, Sere. If you hear a lie rising from the drains, I want your hand to be the first to catch it by the throat."

If someone is coloring the vote, they are not only stealing law, they are stealing the taste of justice from every mouth. Give me three moments and a quiet grate and I will find where the brine goes when it thinks no one is looking. If I have to choose who to shame to keep the peace, I will choose with a steady hand, but do not ask me to keep silent if the ribs begin to sing."

If there is a theft here, the Parliament will deal with it in its own hue, and it will not be a color that flatters you. Do what you must with your priestess and keep your discoveries narrow. A riot can start from a single drop of red in the wrong pool."
