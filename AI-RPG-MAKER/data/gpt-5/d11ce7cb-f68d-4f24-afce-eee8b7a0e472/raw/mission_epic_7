Jaxin Brail led a mule cart draped in canvas that chimed with glass the way a boat keels sings against reeds, his hands careful as a healer's and his eyes alight with the kind of hope that gets written in the Archive if it doesn't get burned first. Wardens in dull armor hammered bone stakes into the basalt rim and strung grounding ropes down into tidepools, their piketips wrapped in eel-skin and prayers, while the crowd at the cliff lip grew until Marshal Isera Bent-Pike's voice had to ride the wind like a thrown hook. Mistress Ashka stood at the array with her kiln-scars catching stray sun, a general before mirrors and lenses, while Caur Spinekeeper folded bone-white diagrams and spoke to the Heartward Engine as if it could hear every word that crossed the foam. Pell Lenseson knelt beside a spiral of stormglass rods cradled in a bone cradle, hands shaking until they touched the coil and found a steadiness born from craft, not courage. The chain hummed out of season with a low animal note that Sere Kallin felt in the bonebrace scar along her ribs, a pressure drop like a hand on her chest, and the Ferryman's token in her pocket went cold without offering any advice. She knew the stakes like she knew the tides: if the chord they chased was true, it might press a calming finger to the city's vast sleeping heart; if it was false, it would wake it in pain and drown every oath and market stall beneath a red tide that no Parliament could vote away. Between sparks of sun and surf, between fire-proud glassmakers and oath-bound bonewrights, Sere had to hold the line, keep Pell alive under a walking sky, and decide whose hand deserved her grip when the first blue vein of lightning reached down like a curious god.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Jaxin Brail and the Collegium apparatus to the Skyhook promontory without incident, guiding carts and mirrors through the ribs and along the basalt path before the storm-bell tolls.\",\n        \"Negotiate a working truce between Mistress Ashka and Caur Spinekeeper for a controlled test, wording terms that satisfy fire and bone alike and keep the Engine's dignity intact.\",\n        \"Protect Pell Lenseson while they align the stormglass coil during a lightning strike, keeping bodies and coil grounded when the sky begins to sing and the chain starts to glow.\",\n        \"Record the chord resonance with the eel-skin codex and secure a usable frequency for later use, ensuring the note can be called without lightning and can be played like a promise rather than a dare.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaxin Brail\", \"lines\": \"You pulled me out of a kiln that was more sky than fire, and I still taste ash when the wind smells like glass. I trust your feet on bad ground because you taught me that even cracked stone has a way of telling you where it wants your weight, and I will step where you point even if the cliff pretends it is a window. Mistress Ashka says we can tune a note from stormglass that will lean into the heartstone's rage and turn it into breath instead of a shout, and I believe her because I have seen lenses teach light to kneel. If we get it right, we put a soft hand on a racing pulse, we save barges that have not yet launched, and we write a new line in the Archive that even Bonewrights can hum. If we get it wrong, the cliff will sing itself to sand, the chain will pluck our names off the wind, and the Wardens will sweep us into jars and whisper apologies to mothers who never liked the Collegium. Help me carry this hope the last stretch, Sere, and if the storm wants a price, I will pay with my hands before it ever looks at yours.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mistress Ashka\", \"lines\": \"Clarity through fire is not a boast; it is a vow I paid for in shards and breath, and the Skyhook owes this city a better hymn than the one it has been humming in secret. Stormglass remembers lightning like bone remembers scars, and if we shape it true it will sing not to break but to mend, a tempered chord that knows the weight of mercy. I have no patience for those who call this blasphemy while they hide their engines behind ritual curtains and pretend they do not burn oil when no one watches, because the sea does not care for our taboos, only our skill. We will pluck a small bolt at sunset, feed it into Pell's coil like a measured draught, and listen with instruments and with the hairs on our arms until the note that calms the heart shows its face. I will honor any safety limit proven by reason, not fear, and I will put my own body between the coil and disaster before I let a crew or a city pay for my ambition. If you can secure the rim and keep fools and saboteurs from leaning in with their curiosity, we will make a medicine from thunder and carry it down into the ribs like a blessing.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Caur Spinekeeper\", \"lines\": \"I grow bone to bridge what breaks, not to count cracks for sport, and the Engine is a patient I have tended longer than most have held breath during winter storms. If your glass sings in the wrong key, the heart will answer as a feverish child answers touching hands, not with thanks but with thrashing, and an entire city can drown in a tantrum it cannot name. I will allow a trial if the chain's hum is steady, if the first surge is small and leashed, and if a cut-off lever stands under my palm like a rib-suture ready to pull. If I smell hubris in the pitch or see a lens glare with heat that glass should not hold, I will break your coil with my own hands and you will find my apology in competent triage rather than words. You will give me your frequencies in ink and in bone-script when you finish, because I will not let this city depend on a hymn nobody but the Collegium can sing. Do this with me and I will call you prudent; do it without me and you will find Wardens between you and the Engine until your hair goes white.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isera Bent-Pike\", \"lines\": \"Wardens, set your stakes, ground your lines, and keep your heads down when the light starts walking, because lightning loves tall pride and iron taller than it loves any of us. If anyone runs toward the coil because a song in their skull told them to be a hero, I will tie their bravery to a mast and let the rain chew on it until even their mothers cannot taste the foolishness anymore. Sere, if thunder swallows my orders, you make the call with your old steadiness and then shout after so the rest of us can pretend we always agreed. I would rather bury one clean mistake than ten brave fools, and I will sign that line in the ledger with my own blood if Parliament wants a witness. Keep an eye out for Black Net noses that sniff around when crowds thicken, because a storm draws thieves like a cracked basin draws brine, and I will not have contraband riding this wind.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pell Lenseson\", \"lines\": \"I carved this coil from stormglass nodules we coaxed from the chain's shadow, using a template that mirrors the old Skyhook chord diagrams we found etched into a rusted link; it looks delicate, but it is tuned to bend rather than break. Each rod is cut to a length that should resonate at a specific overtone when a bolt passes through the spine, and if I align them to the wind and to the chain's hum we should be able to trap the fundamental without shattering the mouth notes. I need ten breaths of quiet when the moment comes, and I need you to be the wall that tells fools and fate to try a different door, because my hands will be busy counting angles that prefer not to be counted. There is a risk of a shatter cone if the surge spikes, and in that case I will throw the ceramic gate and pray to any saint who cares for apprentices, but I would rather not test saints today. The note we seek should feel like a hand smoothing a scared animal's mane, low and steady with a kindness that can be replicated, and if we catch it I can etch it into a whistle skin for you to carry where lightning does not walk. If we fail, I will return my tools to the kiln and my pride to the dust, and we will try again when wiser heads have drawn better circles.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Old Marr\", \"lines\": \"Taste the wind, little Pike, because it brings tales faster than boats and truer than most men; the chain's hum is off by a hair, like a knot tied left-handed on a right-handed line. Where water goes, we go first, but where thunder goes we go only if we can read its map, and today its map says the first bolt will lean toward the fourth link like a drunk to a familiar stool. Do not let them anchor the coil too near that rust scar unless they want the sea to count their ribs, and if they must, then lay a ground-net so fine even the Ferryman would pay to cross it. I have heard a chord like the one they want once, when a stormcaller died on the chain and the wind took her last note and braided it into the tide; it was a soft fifth that made men loosen their fists. If you hear that neighborly note under the roar, you pull it the way you pull a barge free of a mud-lick, patient and steady, because the city will thank you in bread and breath if you do.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Back the Ember Collegium's Lightning Pluck\", \"text\": \"Sere steps between Ashka and the cliff like a hinge between glass and storm, lending her voice to the precise audacity the Kiln-Mother demands. She directs Wardens to widen the safe ring, ties eel-skin lines from bone stakes to the coil frame, and has Jaxin mark distances with chalk that glow like low stars in the oncoming dusk. She persuades Caur with a warrior's honesty, promising that if the surge jumps she will be the first to break the coil by hand, and she accepts the weight of that oath without flinching. As the chain begins to glow along its rust scars, she positions Pell under her buckler's refraction, creating a dull-green shadow that calms the apprentice's breath and keeps stray glare from tearing focus. She orders the first test bolt drawn at sunset's shoulder, trusting Ashka's measures, and keeps her stance like a pike planted in silt while thunder unfurls above.\", \"outcome\": \"The first bolt crawls down the chain and licks the coil like a curious eel before striking true, and the stormglass flexes with a sound like a sigh caught in a bottle instead of a scream. Pell calls angles in a voice that forgets to tremble, and Sere's buckler throws harmless light halos that keep eyes from squinting into missteps, while Ashka feeds the surge through a braided copper lead that behaves. The chord comes through the roar like an oar-beat heard under festival drums, low and neighborly, and Sere feels her rib-scars cool as if a fever has turned. Caur grips the cut-off lever white-knuckled but does not pull, and when the surge fades he nods once in a gesture that admits craft without surrendering doctrine. Jaxin etches the frequency into eel-skin and ash-salts, and Pell hands Sere a tuned whistle skin that will reproduce that calming note without begging the sky again. Mistress Ashka offers formal Collegium favor for fog-cutting lenses and swears the result will be shared, while Caur mutters a grudging trust that will put a door where a wall used to be when Engine rites grow tense.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Stand With Bonewright Caution and Red-Flag Every Safety\", \"text\": \"Sere insists the trial be treated like surgery, not spectacle, and her voice takes on the cadence she learned on the Skyhook watch when a wrong breath meant a dead climber. She demands a smaller first surge, a double-ground to tidepools, Tidemother-blessed brine on the stakes, and a ceramic gate under Caur's hand that can starve the coil in a blink. She has Wardens cut the crowd line back two net-lengths and posts a runner to carry her signal flags to Isera in case thunder eats words. She asks Pell to rehearse the alignment with empty coils, and when the apprentice falters she shows a soldier's trick for counting under panic, tapping rib, shoulder, wrist in a steady ritual. When Ashka bristles, Sere answers with respect without surrender, reminding the Kiln-Mother that the city needs a result that can stand in basins and altars alike.\", \"outcome\": \"When the bolt finally comes, it is a thin spear instead of a broad hand, and the ceramic gate and double ground swallow stray wrath so well the hair on Sere's arms never lifts. The coil hums like a sleep song rather than a war song, Pell aligns with surgical calm, and Caur's jaw unclenches the way a clenched fist forgets its own argument. The chord recorded is gentle but true, a narrow-banked river that promises to deepen with practice, and its frequency writes cleanly into the eel-skin codex without smearing. Ashka's pride bends without breaking, and she admits in a measured tone that results that survive caution are the only results worth scaling, offering her guild's favor with fewer barbs than expected. Isera nods in silent approval at the lack of casualties, the Wardens slack their lines without shame, and Sere walks away with a tuned whistle, a lens-loan promise, and Caur's promise to hear her out when the Engine's doors grow difficult.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Forge a Three-Hand Truce: Fire, Bone, and Warden\", \"text\": \"Sere draws a triangle in wet chalk on basalt and places Ashka, Caur, and Isera at its corners, then stands in the center where lightning might fall because compromise is not negotiated from a safe porch. She speaks of the leviathan's sleeping heart as a child that belongs to no single parent, and she asks each leader to name the thing they cannot surrender so the shape of the test can be cut around it. She folds Old Marr's wind-warning into the plan, shifting the coil two pike-lengths from the rusted fourth link, and braids a Warden ground-net fine enough to make smugglers curse under their breath. She asks for a shared signal, three raised fingers if the hum turns sour, and swears to throw the cut-off lever herself if any one of them shows that sign first. She has Pell teach a Bonewright apprentice and a Warden matron the alignment counts so that when the note is won it already belongs to more than one guild.\", \"outcome\": \"The storm tastes the offered triangle and chooses, sending a bolt that splits around the coil like a river between reeds, and for a heartbeat all three leaders hold breath as if they share a chest. The coil bends rather than breaks, the ground-net catches stray hunger, and the chord that rises is not only steady but braided, with an overtone that sounds like ward-drums across water. Pell and the Bonewright apprentice nod in time, Isera raises one finger then drops it when the hum sweetens, and Ashka laughs once in a way that makes her scars look like medals rather than warnings. The eel-skin codex takes the frequency cleanly, and Sere feels the Ferryman token warm as if a toll has been paid in good faith rather than secrecy. The tuned whistle is pressed into her palm with ceremonial words from Pell, the Collegium signs a lens-loan writ with Isera as witness, and Caur says carefully that when the Engine needs guardians, Sere's voice will be heard before the hammers. The crowd's cheer is smaller than a festival but bigger than a council prayer, and for an hour the Skyhook hums in season as if relieved to have been asked rather than stolen from.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Braid the Wardens' Ground-Net and Divert the Bolt\", \"text\": \"Sere chooses to respect the storm's appetite while denying it any chance to feed where it pleases, and she orders a lattice of eel-skin and copper sunk into tidepools and lashed to bone stakes until the cliff looks like a harp. She plants Wardens with pikes as living anchors, their boots salted and their grips steady, and she has Jaxin chalk grounding marks that even a pan family child could read when sheets of rain come. She moves Pell under a canopy of saint-glass held aloft by two Wardens, so the coil sits in a pool of soft green that calms glare without asking the sky for permission. She shifts the coil's nose toward Old Marr's safer line, and she assigns runners to carry Caur's and Ashka's calls between thunder beats so no decision gets lost in the roar. When the chain brightens like a breath drawn in, she gives the signal, not to challenge the storm but to guide it into a bed already dug for it.\", \"outcome\": \"The lightning leaps, finds the net first, and slides down the braided path with a furious hiss that never becomes a scream, feeding the coil as a river feeds a mill rather than a knife finding skin. Pell adjusts in three practiced motions, the canopy hums but does not crack, and the note that lifts is a low tide-pulse that makes shoulders drop around the ring without anyone knowing why. The eel-skin codex takes the resonance without blistering, and Sere feels the Engine's imagined heartbeat in her bones slow as if the city itself were exhaling after a long held breath. Ashka measures the drop with a lens and nods, pride satisfied not by risk but by craft, and Caur checks every line and does not find cause to break anything but offers Sere a dry, careful thanks. Isera clasps Sere's forearm and says nothing that needs to be written, and a whistle skin with the captured chord is sealed and passed to Sere's keeping along with a quiet note of Collegium favor for fog-cutters. In the days that follow, Caur's grudging trust opens a door in the Engine wards that had been closed to her since she left the Wardens, and the memory of the guided bolt becomes a cautionary tale told with respect rather than with scorn.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"4\", \"6\"], \"next\": [\"8\", \"11\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"A tuned stormglass whistle that can reproduce one calming chord without lightning, its note etched from the Skyhook's captured hum and set in eel-skin so the city can be soothed by breath instead of thunder.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Favor\", \"description\": \"Collegium favor to borrow fog-cutting lenses for later operations, a writ signed in kiln-char and stormglass ink that lets Sere draw clarity from fire when fog or politics thickens.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Caur Spinekeeper's grudging trust during Heartward Engine procedures, a door once barred now opened a careful hand, granting Sere a voice in rites where bone and brine decide how the city keeps its balance.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
