Between the stalls where resin smokes and amberglass glows, coded melodies drift like nets cast across conversation, tugging the wary toward safe lanes and warning those who have too much to hide. Sere Kallin moves with the old Warden cadence and the newer, quieter footfall of someone who has learned the price of being seen; her buckler catches shards of green light, and her stormglass whistle hums once as if to acknowledge the city’s held breath. Keth of the Nets waits at the lip of a cracked rib, smiling in that cut-thin way that suggests mercy and debt are merely different weaves in the same rope, and he speaks of a small errand dressed in reverence: a prayer-packet sealed in wax, to be slipped through a maintenance rung and tucked into a cracked conduit close enough to the Heartward Engine to feel its measured pulse. He calls it a whisper, but Sere remembers the red tide and the way the Engine sang the city into panic, and she knows some whispers are shaped like keys; this one is a pulse pattern etched into saint-glass, a rhythm designed to coax open a drowned water gate that the Tidemothers insist must remain sleeping. The rung-path he offers is old and secret, a tunnel sealed with wax that bends away from watchlamps, its floor polished by contraband feet and its ceiling close enough to kiss; it leads through the city’s marrow where bone pistons boom like distant thunder and every breath fogs into prayer. Wardens prowl the edges of this territory, not fully welcome and never fully absent, and rumor says the Crown Gate jaw can grind shut on a traitor’s ankle faster than any man can shout for mercy. What Keth truly offers, under the polite veil of trade, is a loosening of the knots that bind Sere’s name to ledgers and a chance to pull one thread free before the whole net tightens, but every gift tied to the Engine drips with consequence. She must choose in the dim thrum of the city’s heart: deliver the whisper and earn clean ledgers, break the glass and draw ire enough to salt her sleep, or carve a new rhythm with stormglass and pilot lore, risking a lesser opening that answers to her call once. And if anyone watches from the shadows—some Black Net lookout eager to shine in Keth’s ledger—she must leave behind only the hush of water and a trail scoured so clean that even old friends in Warden gray could not swear she ever walked that rung at all.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Keth of the Nets at the Ribsward Bazaar and receive the sealed prayer-packet.\",\n        \"Trace the wax-sealed rib tunnel toward the Heartward Engine without attracting the Wardens.\",\n        \"Decide whether to plant the packet in the cracked conduit, destroy it, or alter the pattern with your stormglass shard.\",\n        \"Confront a Black Net lookout if discovered and leave no trail that leads back to your old Warden patrol.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Keth of the Nets\", \"lines\": \"Weigh your choices like salt, Sere, grain by grain, because too much at once blinds the tongue and ruins the stew. What I am asking is smaller than fear and larger than pride, a hush wrapped in wax that only needs your steady hands and your old knack for walking where hooks don’t catch. You do not need to know its hymn, and in truth, knowing would only paint targets on both our backs and invite questions that end in rooms with no windows. Debts climb bone ladders faster than feet, and you have a few rungs left before the drop; I offer you a rope, and I won’t even ask you to count the knots aloud. Walk the maintenance rung, tuck the whisper into the crack that thirsts for it, and I will loosen the ledger that whistles your name like a curse each time a collector turns a page. Think of your mother’s brace when the rain comes in off the Nine Mouths, and imagine that ache softened by kindness that doesn’t ask to be named in public, only remembered in the right tavern when a favor tries to grow teeth again.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sere Kallin\", \"lines\": \"I’ve carried better for worse men and worse for better women, and I’ve learned that mercy often comes wrapped in the same cloth as bait. Do not gild this as charity, Keth, because the city’s heart hears lies as clearly as bells and returns them with interest. I have stood on the Skyhook when the chain sang out of season and felt my bones answer, and I have heard the Engine’s breath stutter like a sick drummer until the Tidemothers soothed it with songs that tasted of salt and thunder. If I take your packet, it is not because I trust your intentions, but because I trust the rung I can see more than the knife I cannot; at least if I carry it, I have a say in how close it gets to the red pulse. And if you had gone to another courier, one hungrier or one who thinks the ribs are only stairs and not a promise, the city would have woken with a new scar and I with a heavier one, so here we are, trading whispers for weather.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isera Bent-Pike\", \"lines\": \"If I catch you near the Heartward Engine on a night without a writ, I will hold you by the jawbone and ask questions with the patience of a tide carving stone. I taught you the first rule of ribs: do not make them sing unless the city asks, and the city speaks in orders and oaths, not in eel-light bargains. Whatever debts lean on your name, bring them to me like you would a fracture, in daytime and with the truth, and I will set them as clean as I can so the ache dulls when it rains. I did not raise you to trade your oath for a purse’s wink or to be dragged like contraband through tunnels your boots once mapped for patrol. Turn back while the only thing I have to write in my ledger beside your name is worry, and not a report that tastes of betrayal.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rhy Tidesong\", \"lines\": \"The city’s heart beats because we ask it to in the right way, at the right hour, and with water that knows our names, and anything else is vanity with teeth. Do not be fooled by any who call a pulse a prayer when it is a pry-bar, for gates open to many songs and most of them lead to rooms where drowning wears a crown. If you must walk where the Engine hums its oldest hymns, carry your breath like a promise and keep iron thoughts far from your tongue, for even unspoken words can weigh water toward wrath. There are gates within gates, child of the Nine Mouths, and some were sealed by grief that still stains stone; you cannot know which grief you’ll free until it stands beside you asking what debt you meant to pay. Should your hand tremble when it comes to the glass, sing first, and remember that the deep forgives, but it never forgets a name.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lur Oghrim\", \"lines\": \"I smell river-reeded caution on you, and I see Warden polish clinging to your stance like barnacles that forgot their ship sank, so do not pretend you’re just another night-seller with a pouch of resin. Keth pays me to count shadows and salt footprints, and he says the one I seek tonight will not flinch when the bones groan, which makes me think you will do. I have eyes in the eel-glow and ears in the bazaar songs, and the tunes tell me a packet is walking that should be carried by hands less scrupulous or more afraid. You could tell me to step aside, and I might, but only if you give me something heavier than fear to weigh against my place in the ledgers and my seat at the nets. Speak now with a truth that tastes of tide, or I will start singing for the Wardens in a key that brings pikes to bear and shuts every rung that doesn’t throw us both into debt we cannot pay.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Plant the Prayer as Ordered\", \"text\": \"You draw breath as if the whole ribcage were a lung and move like an oath kept under the tongue, hugging shadow where bone meets amberglass and eel-jars blink to your rhythm. The wax-sealed packet is a cool weight against your palm, a tremor waiting to be named, and you cradle it the way you once cradled a tally that decided bread for a basin. Past the old rung markers that only smugglers and Wardens remember, you taste brine on your teeth and hear the Engine thrum as if a giant slept behind the wall with its mouth ajar. You kneel by the cracked conduit, feeling the leak-mist bead on your brow, and slide the glass whisper into the wound like an apology you will never say aloud. Then you let the water take it, whisper a pilot’s knot-prayer for careful currents, and step back into darkness with your heartbeat set to the city’s unsteady drum.\", \"outcome\": \"The Engine does not roar; it inhales, and in that intake a low gate somewhere far below twitches like a dreamer, not waking but remembering the word for shore. Keth’s smile deepens into something almost human when you return, and true to his promise he cuts a knot from a ledger line and salts the frayed ends so they cannot be tied again by clumsy hands. Word travels through the Bazaar that your name is lighter, and collectors begin to look at other prey, though you feel their gaze linger like a draft in a closed room. You memorize each bend of the hidden rung as if the bones themselves were your map, and the knowledge sits in your mind like a green lamp that can be lit when checkpoints harden and pikes angle the wrong way. Yet at night you hear distant sluices murmur to one another in a language that might be water or might be memory, and you wonder if some smaller door now stands ajar at the bottom of the city, counting down in drops.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Shatter the Glass and Salt the Whisper\", \"text\": \"You stop at the cracked conduit and feel the pulse like a warning bell under your thumbs, a rhythm you do not trust to be led by any hand but a tide-priest’s. The packet calls to you with a sweet little lie about being only a prayer, and you answer with discipline learned on the Skyhook: you put it against stone and press until the saint-glass sings into pieces. Shards glitter in the dim like trapped stars, and you gather them in your buckler and sprinkle salt from your belt pouch, a fisher’s ward to weigh down reckless wishes. The taste of brine and glass dust is sharp as a lesson, and the Engine’s hum settles, as if pleased that an itch was not scratched. You scatter the salted grit into the leak-mist and watch it vanish as if swallowed by a satisfied throat, then you turn back up the rung with your shoulders squared to meet consequences you now own.\", \"outcome\": \"Keth’s eyes cool to pearl-gray when you report, and his grin becomes the paper-thin edge of a knife; the favor he promised stays promised, but he changes the tense like a miser with a broken abacus and says that not all coins are minted in the same season. You still win quiet thanks from quarters that do not stamp gratitude into clay—temple whispers soften around your name, and a Tidemother acolyte leaves a braid of river grass at your door like a blessing that refuses to speak. The hidden rung remains a path in your mind, and you step through Warden nets with ease born of practice and the knowledge of where the city bends away from watchlight. Yet a lookout’s rumor grows teeth and nips at your heels; the Black Net begins to weigh you as a liability with sharp potential, and you see more left hands brush knife-hilts when you pass. When the rains come, your mother’s brace still aches, and you feel every flinch like a debt that multiplied in the dark, even as you like yourself better when you meet your reflection in saint-glass.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Etch a New Rhythm with the Stormglass\", \"text\": \"You set the packet against your knee and listen to the Engine’s hum until your bones remember their old habit of counting beats without numbers, just distance and need. The stormglass whistle at your throat cools, then warms, answering a pressure change that only you and the Skyhook swifts seem to care about, and you take a shard from its leather sleeve. Scratching counter-melody into saint-glass is like plucking thunder with a fishbone pick; it wants to leap from your hand, but you guide it with pilot’s patience and Warden stubbornness. You etch a notch, then two, rewriting a cadence so the whisper will lead not to a drowned vault the size of a basilica but to a lesser sluice, a gate meant for floods to be bled safely without waking the city’s deeper sleep. When the new pattern is cut, you press the glass to the conduit and let the leak-mist kiss it into the dark, then you place a palm to bone and promise the long body of the leviathan that you will ask before you sing again.\", \"outcome\": \"Something below answers, not with the groan of a titan but with the relieved sigh of a narrow hinge long rusted; a lesser water gate stirs and then stills, its name written in you as surely as in stone. You return with the certainty of a navigator who has charted a new channel, and you copy the revised pulse onto oiled vellum and into memory, a secret you will spend only once because the city allows no second plucking of the same chord. Keth honors the letter of his promise because your hands did the work, even if your song was not the one he sent; he wipes a ledger clean where it matters most and pretends not to notice how you did it, though his eyes take the measure of your audacity with grudging admiration. The hidden rung becomes more than a path: it becomes a route whose ending you own, a bypass that will carry you past a Warden checkpoint like a ghost when you must fly without wake. For days after, the Engine’s hum matches your heartbeat when you pass the sternum’s great braces, and you understand, with a thrill and a warning, that you now carry a key whose teeth fit only one lock and whose breakage would be a sin and a salvation all at once.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Spin the Lookout and Scrub the Trail\", \"text\": \"When the lookout slides from eel-glow and shadow like a knife drawn from a sleeve, you greet him with the tired familiarity of a city that taught you three languages of threat and two of mercy. You talk of false schedules and decoy couriers, of tax songs sung out of key to draw nets away, and you lace each lie with a truth heavy enough to keep the blend from floating. Your Saint-Glass Buckler throws soft green light into his eyes at moments you choose, buying you heartbeats to lay false footprints in the dew of leak-mist and to brush away the true with a fisher’s gentle patience. You leave a scrap of cloth that belonged to a Warden quartermaster you know is on leave, and you hum a river tune that smugglers avoid, a hymn that says warded, warded, warded in the mouths of frogs and the turn of reeds. By the time you slip past, the lookout is arguing with his own suspicions, and your trail is so clean that even you could not swear you walked it.\", \"outcome\": \"The Black Net’s rumor mill grinds for nothing when it tries to spit out your route; three different accounts place you in three different ribs, and Keth’s ledgers shake off your footprints like a dog shedding river water. Wardens grumble at a false trail that leads them to a harmless rung capped with wax older than their promotions, and your old patrol finds nothing to stain the memory of the badge you still wear as a pendant. Keth is frustrated, but he cannot scold success without looking like a fool to his own, so he pays the debt with visible reluctance and invisible interest you can taste but not measure. Your map of hidden paths grows, and the rung you walked becomes part of your inner city, a place you can go with your eyes shut and your body listening. Later, when storms close the Nine Mouths and the Ferryman’s token chills against your skin, you will thank this night for teaching you how to pass like fog over eel-slick bone without leaving even a whisper behind.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"2\"], \"next\": [\"4\", \"9\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"favor\", \"description\": \"A promise from Keth that removes your name from one smuggler ledger, cutting a knot from the line that has trailed you since the Bazaar learned your debts.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"knowledge\", \"description\": \"Knowledge of a hidden rung path that bypasses a Warden checkpoint, memorized in bends of bone and pools of shadow rather than ink and chart.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"arcane pattern\", \"description\": \"If the packet is altered: a revised pulse pattern that can open a lesser water gate once, a single-use rhythm etched in memory like a chord plucked from the Skyhook.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
