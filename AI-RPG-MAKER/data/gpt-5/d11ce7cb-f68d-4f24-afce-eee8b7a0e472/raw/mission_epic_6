Fog came to lay upon it like folded wool, muffling oar and word, and in that hush the old rumor put on bones: the Ferryman Without Wake poled there, answering what could not be asked in daylight for the price of a name. Holl Riverborn found Sere Kallin beneath a rib where eel-jars flickered and pressed into her palm a colder token and an older chant, a prayer the eels themselves remember when the tide panics and turns on itself. The skiff would pass markers no pilot set, bone poles carved with knots no hand had taught, and the water would show paths that could only be seen from the mirror side where the sky is a river and the river is a sky. The question to be ferried upriver of sense was simple and sharp: where must the seven chords be plucked so that the heartstone, that red engine under Marrowgate, can be lulled instead of angered. The answer would not be bought with coin measured in basins or glass counters cast by kilns, for the river keeps a dearer cashiering; it would be weighed in speaking, and paid with a name that once loosed would not return unchanged.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\"Meet Holl Riverborn at a hidden mooring and accept the charge to seek the Ferryman.\", \"Pole a skiff down the uncharted tenth mouth using the eel-chant to calm eddies.\", \"Offer the Ferryman a name and ask where the seven chords must be plucked to lull the heartstone.\", \"Return with the answer and choose whether to reveal the name you paid to any living soul.\"],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Holl Riverborn\", \"lines\": \"There are routes you cannot see until you stop leaving wakes behind you, Sere, and I say this as one who has spent a lifetime learning to soften the oar. The Ferryman teaches that lesson to those who come to him with too many ripples in their past, and you and I both know your wake is a story the river already hums. I will not tell you what name to pay, because a paid name is a wound that must be chosen and not assigned, and a wound given is not the same as a wound taken. A fair price is your own choosing, and fairness in this work is not kindness but balance, like a skiff that does not list when the tide turns. Ask where to play the chords and ask what happens if we play them wrong, because only fools pluck strings without listening to the wind they make, and the wrong song can wake a sleeping thing. Truth tastes different when you learn it from a mouth that does not stir the water, and if you taste iron, you will know the chords are near a wound and if you taste salt only, you will know the chords are near a memory.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sere Kallin\", \"lines\": \"I have given a name to the river before and it followed me like a cold hand on my spine, and since that night I have learned to sleep with my back to the wall and my face to the door. If I must pay again, I will choose a name already heavy with its own guilt, for I will not set another innocent afloat without oars. The token in my palm is colder than ever, and the fog that gathers around it is the kind that makes even lanterns swallow their light and hold it like a fish in the gullet. I will ask plainly and listen carefully, and if the answer is a knife I will carry it edge outward so I cut only what needs cutting, and I will sheath it when the work is done and not a heartbeat later. If the water shows me routes seen only from the other side of the mirror, I will not flinch, because I have learned that fear is a current and you either read it or it reads you.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sela Tidecount\", \"lines\": \"You will not be alone out there even if you think you are, because fog has a way of pressing a crowd of old choices close against your shoulders until you feel their breath. Fog has a way of showing you your own back if you keep looking forward, and if you catch a glimpse of your braid in front of you, do not reach for it, let it pass like a fish shadow. Tie two knots into the rope at your wrist and taste the wind between them, because wind trapped between clean knots tells truth truer than any chart, and I have trusted those two knots more than I have trusted ten pilots in a row. If it tastes like rain before the scent of fish, turn left at the next singing stone, because rain-first means the river is in a telling mood and favors the old channel, and left will keep you in the old tongue. If you smell fish first, turn right and do not argue, because fish-first is hunger and hunger cuts new paths that punish hesitation. If you taste nothing at all, you have already met him and his silence has stripped your senses, and that is when you must count your breaths and not your doubts.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Old Marr\", \"lines\": \"The chain hums out of season and that means the river is eavesdropping, so mind your words and mind your oar, little knot, because the water writes in eddies and remembers in silt. Your buckler will scatter lantern glare but not lull a jealous current, so use your voice and use the eel-chant like a pilot flag that speaks to gills instead of eyes. There are bone poles out there carved with knots that never passed my hall, and I do not like a knot I did not teach, so if you find one do not untie it with your hands, untie it with your patience and let the water finish the job. The Ferryman Without Wake is not a ghost and not a saint, he is a route given a face, and if you think that is a riddle, you have never steered a barge through a fog that thought itself a gate. Remember that a name spoken is a route opened, and a name paid is a route closed behind you, and the only choice you truly have is which gate you want to leave open when you come back to us.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ferryman Without Wake\", \"lines\": \"You have poled beyond sound until sound forgot itself, and you have sung until the water remembered being a throat, and that is why I am here without moving and why you have arrived without arriving. Names are stones dropped in the mouth of the world, and the ripples taste like copper or salt depending on whether the stone was stolen or given, and I eat only what I am offered because a thief of names starves in the long run. If you bring me your own name, I will drink the shadow of it and leave you lighter to pass places that do not abide weight, and if you bring me another's, I will still answer but the current you ride home will carry a bruise. Ask your question and hear your fear parade itself as caution, and then listen beneath that, where the eel chant coils and uncoils like a sleeping river, because there the truth keeps its tools. The seven chords must be played where thunder was once shepherded and where water breathes in a chamber cut from a sleeping heart, and if you pluck them wrong you will not wake the city at once but teach the bones to crack on a beat they cannot forget, and that is a worse kindness than drowning.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"c1\", \"title\": \"Pay your own true name, Sere Kallin\", \"text\": \"You let the fog press close and you speak your name as your mother spoke it when you were small, with the river lilt and the soft chime on the last syllable that only the Nine Mouths know. You feel the taste of copper fade from your tongue and something lighter slip from your shoulders as if a soaked cloak were unpinned and carried away. The token in your palm grows colder still, then warm, then steady, and the skiff drifts though no pole has touched mud and no eddy has kissed the hull. Your scars tremble once and the tremor does not hurt, it simply points, like a needle that has finally found the vein it sought. In that moment, you understand that a part of your weight in the city has been lifted and that weight was the way your name fit into every mouth that spoke it, and now it will not fit so easily.\", \"outcome\": \"The Ferryman drinks the shadow of your name and answers fully, describing the Skyhook Chain as the place where the seven chords must be plucked at the very moment the Heartward Engine opens its hidden water gate to the heart chamber, and his words leave a taste of rain-iron on your teeth that means urgency. For nights to come, people who know you hesitate a heartbeat before saying your name, and in crowded markets you can move like a breeze that takes the heat but not the smoke, which is a blessing and a loneliness. Wardens on patrol look past you once before their eyes find your face, and Marshal Isera feels the miss in her memory and grows concerned without knowing why, tightening watches around the Crown Gate out of instinct. Keth of the Nets hears that a question was asked and finds that his runners remember you as 'the woman with the river eyes' instead of by name, and while it spares you some knives in the dark it earns you a new kind of notice from those who chase rumors. The Ferryman's faint mark seals itself into your token like a wet leaf pressed into vellum, promising one more question at a moonless night, and when you hood your lantern twice upon your return, a ghost-chart wakes with paths drawn in lines of patient green.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"c2\", \"title\": \"Pay the name of Keth of the Nets, your dangerous creditor\", \"text\": \"You taste the risk like ground glass and speak the broker's name in full, the one he only uses when coins are counted in blood and not in silver, and the fog seems to swallow the consonants as if they were meat. Your voice does not shake, but the skiff creaks once as if it knows the cost of buying your own skin with someone else's. You remember resin smuggled and a ward matron's thanks and the way Keth smiled like a cut when you paid part of your debt, and the eel-chant tightens into a braid of notes that feels more like a rope than a song. The token grows colder and does not warm, and somewhere in the wool of the fog a single drop falls like the tap of a counting stick. The water does not punish you, but it does not forgive you either, and that chill settles like a ledger entry yet to be collected.\", \"outcome\": \"The Ferryman answers, but his voice is thinner, as if the route he opens for you has more edges than before, and still he tells you that the seven chords must be plucked upon the Skyhook Chain while the Heartward Engine's water gate yawns to the heart chamber, and that the timing matters like breath between cries. When you return, the Black Net wakes as if pricked, because Keth feels a thread tug somewhere behind his eyes and does not know why a name he owns has grown lighter in his mouth, and his people begin to watch the ribs you walk and the lantern you carry. Your token bears the faint mark of the Ferryman but the design is like a hairline crack in saint-glass, delicate and true, and it promises one more question even as it warns that debts can echo. In the Ribsward Bazaar, you find prices set one notch steeper and ladders with new loose rungs where you would least like them, and a coded melody from the bazaar singers warns you that the Seamstress wants a word. The chart that appears when you hood your lantern twice is complete but one path along the tenth mouth is smudged as if a wet finger were dragged across it, and that smudge hums low when you pass near a Black Net rung.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"c3\", \"title\": \"Pay the name of Aro Pike-Second, a corrupt Warden you once exposed in whispers\", \"text\": \"You speak the name like a splinter you have been waiting to pull, and the syllables are thick with parade polish and the stink of eel smoke and easy bribes taken in the shadow of a molar vault. Your old Warden instinct makes your shoulders square even as the fog unbuttons your pride and lays the old hurt bare, because you remember the night you traded a name to the Ferryman to save a skiff full of panicked children. The eel-chant wavers around the bitter taste, then steadies, and your buckler catches a ghost light that is not yours and sets it adrift. You feel the water tilt, not against you but away from the man whose name you paid, and you think of Marshal Isera and of oaths that were not meant to be twisted until they creaked. The token in your palm shivers twice like a fish trying to live on a deck and then goes still, and in that stillness you hear the city breathe.\", \"outcome\": \"The Ferryman's answer comes with the unvarnished weight of a verdict, and he tells you the seven chords are to be plucked at the Skyhook Chain when the Heartward Engine's inner water gate opens to the heart chamber, and he adds a quiet warning that iron brought too close will sour the song. Word travels along Warden teeth faster than it should that something has shifted, and although no one can say what, Sergeant Blue counts his pikes and mutters that the water tastes strange, while Isera Bent-Pike dreams once of chains and wakes with her hand on a horn. Aro Pike-Second stumbles on a wet rung and does not fall, but the fear of falling takes up residence in his knees, and he begins looking over his shoulder more than he looks down a street, which makes space for you to move. Your token bears the Ferryman’s faint mark like a thumbprint, granting you one more moonless question, and the chart you reveal with a lantern hooded twice shows a clean, sharp line through the tenth mouth with a note etched in light that reads, 'Do not bring iron.' The Temple of the Tidemothers hears the rumor of a name paid by one of their former blades, and Mother Rhy lights a blue wick and waits for you to come to speak without asking how you earned the answer you carry.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"c4\", \"title\": \"Refuse a living name and offer a future name you swear to earn\", \"text\": \"You keep your lips pressed against the old habit of oaths and offer instead the name you have not yet earned, the one you have dreamed in secret and never said aloud, the one that smells of stormglass and chain-thunder and a skiff's prow, and you promise to make it true. The fog listens the way a courtroom listens when a witness swallows, and the eel-chant turns into a rope thrown to your own future self with a knot tied just where your hand will need it. You say that if the name is not made real you consent to pay with something dearer, and you understand in that moment that bargains with routes are not like bargains with men because routes do not forget. The skiff drifts without wake as if the water were holding its breath, and your token warms so slowly you would miss it if not for the tremor in your wrist that sings when pressure changes. The price you feel accepted is a hook more than a coin, but it is your hook and you set it with your own hand.\", \"outcome\": \"The Ferryman accepts with a stillness that feels like a tide turning mid-surge, and he tells you that the seven chords must be played upon the Skyhook Chain as the Heartward Engine opens its water gate to the heart chamber, and he tells you that if you fail to become what you have named yourself, the current will come for your question the next time you open your mouth to ask. The token bears the faint mark, but it is braided with a second, subtler curve like a promise thread that warms when you take steps toward the title you vowed, granting one more question at a moonless night only if you honor your own word. On your way back, you find that the channels you choose seem to lean toward you, and you cannot tell if that is boon or surveillance, and in the Ribsward Bazaar a glass saint mask reflects your face with a cloak over your shoulders you do not yet own. Those who deal in oaths and those who smell for lies glance at you and then away, as if your path is too bright to look upon directly, and Old Marr’s apprentices whisper that the rope at your wrist has started to memorize your pull. The chart that appears when you hood your lantern twice shows the tenth mouth’s routes in fine braided lines like a plait not yet tied off, and a margin note in pale green reads, 'Promises hold water until they do not,' which is both comfort and warning.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"5\"], \"next\": [\"7\", \"8\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Knowledge\", \"description\": \"An answer: that the seven chords must be plucked at the Skyhook Chain while the Heartward Engine’s water gate is open to the heart chamber, spoken in terms so clear they ring in your bones.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Mark\", \"description\": \"The Ferryman’s faint mark on your token, allowing one more question at a later moonless night, the sign as cool as dew and hard to show to anyone who has not paid the river.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Chart\", \"description\": \"A current chart that only appears when lantern light is hooded twice, its lines glimmering like eel-spines and shifting only when you breathe steady.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
