She held the Skyhook watch during monsoons and fought barnacle ogres off the low links, then escorted basin tallies through the Ribsward Bazaar where she first crossed paths with Keth of the Nets. During the red tide thirteen years ago she was a raw recruit ferrying panicked families when the Heartward Engine flared; the pulse left her with a tremor and a knack for sensing pressure changes that engineers call bad luck and Tidemothers call listening. Years later, needing resin and a fast brace for her mother’s shattered arm, she took Keth’s quiet help and paid by steering a Warden sweep away from a rung ladder; when the ledger of favors grew teeth, she resigned her post under Marshal Isera Bent-Pike rather than drag her patrol into scandal. Since then Sere has worked as a hired shield on bone ladders and canal runs, guiding Ember Collegium couriers like Jaxin Brail past smugglers and storms, and venturing into the Gloomroot with Vara Rootlight to fetch glow fungus for the Ossuary Archive. She knows the hum of the Engine, the songs of the wind-harps from the Cairn of the Hollow King, and the taste of fog that means the Ferryman’s routes are close; now she walks the ribs trying to repay debts without selling her oath, and to keep the leviathan sleeping without letting any one guild hold the city by its throat.\"\n  ,\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Rib-Splitter Pike\",\n      \"description\": \"A Warden-issue bone pike rehafted with mangrove resin, its grip carved with pilot knots and shallow tally marks for lives protected.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saint-Glass Buckler\",\n      \"description\": \"A tempered saint-glass shield rimmed in eel-bone that refracts lantern light to dazzle foes and can signal Pilots in coded flashes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Eel-Skin Coil\",\n      \"description\": \"A forty-foot rope braided from cured eel-skin that holds true in brine; one section is marked with a hidden Black Net rung sigil.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Bonebrace Harness\",\n      \"description\": \"Covenant-grown shoulder and rib braces that stiffen when struck and ease when sung to at a low pitch.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Stormglass Whistle\",\n      \"description\": \"A shard-tuned whistle that sings when pressure drops or when the Skyhook Chain hums out of season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ferryman Token\",\n      \"description\": \"A smooth river stone etched with a wake-less skiff; grows colder near uncharted channels and unanswered questions.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 16,\n    \"agility\": 14,\n    \"constitution\": 15,\n    \"intelligence\": 12,\n    \"wisdom\": 11,\n    \"charisma\": 13,\n    \"dexterity\": 14,\n    \"endurance\": 15,\n    \"perception\": 14,\n    \"luck\": 10\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Leadership under pressure\",\n    \"Streetwise negotiation\",\n    \"River navigation and knots\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Keth of the Nets\": \"A dangerous creditor and sometime informant; he smuggled resin for Sere’s mother’s brace and now expects favors in return, but Sere keeps a knife-edge truce and trades him false leads when lives are at stake.\",\n    \"Jaxin Brail\": \"An Ember Collegium lens courier and junior lenswright whom Sere pulled from a kiln blast; he pays her in coin and glasswork, and leaks Collegium rumors about stormglass experiments near the Skyhook.\",\n    \"Vara Rootlight\": \"A Gloomroot guide and Tidemother novice who reads glow fungus like scripture; she saved Sere from quickmire, and the two share trust strained by temple vows and Sere’s history with smugglers.\",\n    \"Marshal Isera Bent-Pike\": \"Former commander and stern mentor; respects Sere’s courage but suspects her resignation hid a scandal, keeping a watchful distance.\",\n    \"Old Marr\": \"Master of Knots who taught Sere to read current by taste and hum; a stern uncle-figure who slips her ghost-route hints when storms gather.\",\n    \"Mother Rhy\": \"Tide-Mother who oversaw pulse rites when Sere’s tremors began; insists Sere attend rites and avoid iron near the Engine, and calls on her as a blade when tempers flare at the basins.\"\n  },\n  \"ambitions\": \"To expose a quiet pact between Black Net brokers and a basin faction, win back honor enough to captain a Warden skiff, and earn a say in stewardship of the Heartward Engine without ceding it to any single guild.\",\n  \"flaws\": \"Stubborn to the point of refusing retreat, debt-bound to a smuggler she despises, and plagued by red-pulse tremors and risk-seeking surges near the Engine; mistrusts scholars and bristles at temple taboos.\",\n  \"dreams\": \"To calm the leviathan’s heart so the ribs never sing in panic again, to walk the Skyhook Chain and pluck the seven chords said to soothe the city, and to chart the rumored tenth mouth that sings at night.\",\n  \"secrets\": \"Sere once swapped a basin hue at the Salt Parliament on Keth’s orders to tilt a vote, then destroyed the proof; she paid the Ferryman Without Wake with the name of a corrupt Warden to learn a ghost route during a fog riot; and she carries a memorized sequence of three ribs to strike that could open a hidden water gate beneath the Heartward Engine.\"\n}"
