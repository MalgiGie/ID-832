"{\n  \"city\": \"Marrowgate, called the Ribs of the Tide, is a river-delta metropolis built within the exposed skeleton of a sea-leviathan that rose from the flats six centuries ago. The city clings to ribs like terraces of bone and amberglass, with sailcloth roofs strung between vertebrae to catch monsoon winds. Its skull is a gate-citadel facing the Inner Shard Sea, and its tail vertebrae anchor docks that spider out into brine channels lit by ghostfire lanterns. Marrowgate survives on salt, bonecraft, glassmaking, river trade, and a deft balance of guild power. The Salt Parliament, a council of basin-families, convenes around evaporative pools to cast votes with colored brine, while the River Pilots guide all freight through the Nine Mouths of the delta. Bonewrights carve living bone into tools and constructs, and the Ember Collegium fires glass in desert kilns, turning dune-sand into saint-bright panes and lenses. The Tidemothers keep rites for the great water and teach that the leviathan is not dead but sleeping, its heartstone a red engine that must be soothed to keep the city from sinking. History here is written in cracked rib and patched sail. Founders were salt-panners and eel-spears who claimed the bones after the Stormfall Night, when a star broke and the sea retreated, exposing the leviathan. Three centuries ago, Scythe Sultans from the dunes laid siege until river storms broke their siege ladders with thunder pulled from the Skyhook chain. The Chordquake of 179 years past split the third rib and birthed the Ribsward Bazaar in the gap. Thirteen years ago, the heartstone flared and turned the water red; the Bonewright Covenant and Tidemothers bargained an uneasy accord to damp the pulse. Marrowgate depends on upstream grain terraces, resin and timber from mangrove and crag forests, sand from singing dunes, and the pilots who read shifting channels. Its conflicts are as tidal as its fortunes: smugglers of the Black Net bleed tariffs, the Collegium and Covenant contest the use of heart-power, and the Wardens keep a brittle peace with pikes and dull armor. Legends persist that the Ferryman Without Wake passes the channels on moonless nights, that thunder still sleeps in the broken Skyhook, and that when the leviathan truly stirs, every bone-stair in Marrowgate will sing.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Salt Prism Flats\",\n      \"type\": \"salt flats\",\n      \"description\": \"Miles of mirror-bright salt pans east of the city, stepped by old guild lines and freckled with half-submerged obelisks from a civilization that worshipped light.
