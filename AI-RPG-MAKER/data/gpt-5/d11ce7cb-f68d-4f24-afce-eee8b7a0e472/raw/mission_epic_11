Dead links that had not sung in a century began to glow faint as embers under eel-slick mist, and each dull pulse seemed to answer the red beat Sere Kallin felt in the bones of her own chest. The eel-skin codex had been unrolled on a prayer table, its ink raised like threads that hummed when the stormglass whistle sang, and the heart-pulse measure ticked with a stubborn patience that dared anyone to rush. Seven chords had revealed themselves across the links as distances, hums, and tastes of wind, a sequence that wanted a climber’s grip, a pilot’s ear, and a singer’s gentleness. Rhy Tidesong gathered them by lantern in the Engine’s shadow—Sela Tidecount to read gust and lull, Jaxin Brail to weigh lightning in glass, Vara Rootlight to set the waves listening without asking for answer, and Sere to place hands and courage at the edge where water and sky meet iron. They would open the hidden water gate within the Heartward Engine so the city’s sleeping heart could hear a lullaby offered to the storm, and then they would climb where ghosts and gulls dared. From the basalt foot where the chain rose, the city seemed small enough to pocket, a scatter of lanterns like shrimp in a net, and the Nine Mouths braided black and silver toward the sea. The first link thrummed under Sere’s palm with a sound like a distant cellist speaking through metal, and the Wind tasted of ozone, resin smoke from the kilns, and the cold tang that whispers when the Ferryman passes. It was time to pluck the sky, and to trust that a song could be a rope strong enough to keep a city from sinking.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Coordinate with Sela Tidecount, Jaxin Brail, and Vara Rootlight to time the climb and the gate opening.\",\n        \"Pluck the seven chords at their marked links in the correct sequence without being knocked free by wind or lightning.\",\n        \"Signal the Heartward Engine team to close the gate at the final note and record the pulse settling.\",\n        \"Survive the backwash of power and see whether the city’s bones stop singing.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rhy Tidesong\", \"lines\": \"You will be my hand where my feet cannot go, Sere Kallin, and I will be your breath when the sky tries to steal it. Measure your heart against the Engine’s metronome we practiced, and if panic presses, let the breath be longer than the fear. If the chords begin to argue with one another, do not strike them harder; slow them with kindness until each remembers its place at the table. The heart is old and proud, but it sleeps better to lullabies than to orders, and it will forgive a hesitant note sooner than it forgives a command barked like a Warden’s drill. Leave iron far from your thoughts and hands when you touch those links, and let your voice, even unspoken, be a promise that nothing cruel comes up the chain tonight. Trust that I am below with the gate open and listening, and if you falter, I will lend you a measure and a prayer to make the next reach feel like coming home.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sela Tidecount\", \"lines\": \"Feel the rope hum and you will know which way the wind is already leaning, because wind talks first to cord and then to skin. Do not fight the gusts like they insulted your mother; roll your shoulder into them and let them think they’ve won while your feet keep climbing where only you know. When I call three short and one long, the gust is a bully and you should hug the iron like a friend only until it passes, and when I sing a flat note you will find the next handhold where you least expect it. If you hear me curse, it is a good sign; it means I still have breath and the chain has not yet taught me new words. Watch for sky swift nests tucked under the third link and do not kick at them, because they know the old currents better than our charts. And if the lantern goes green-blue-green-blue-green, that is my way of saying wait a heartbeat and then trust the drop, because the air has a hand ready to lift you.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaxin Brail\", \"lines\": \"The coil is primed and the whistle remembers the last thunder like a sweet tooth that aches when rain thinks of falling. I have tuned the stormglass to the Engine’s measure, and if I tell you to wait one heartbeat before the next note, trust that my fear is doing math faster than my courage can admit. Lightning is a conversationalist when treated with respect, and it will answer the right question with a step to the left instead of a strike to the heart. If this works, we will not hear victory as a shout or a cheer; we will hear the absence of panic, and in that quiet you will feel your bones loosen like hands unclenching. Should a hum come out sour, do not be ashamed of a second pluck gentled by breath; glass forgives more than men do, and the sky is closer to glass today than it is to iron. I will keep my hands steady even if my voice trembles, and I will count for you when the wind tries to turn numbers into noise.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Vara Rootlight\", \"lines\": \"I will keep the water listening without asking it to answer, and I will braid my hymn between wave and link so the sea does not grow jealous of the sky’s song. If you slip, I will do all I can to make the river softer than it knows how to be, but I would rather sing for a climbing friend than a falling one, so let us agree that you will not fall. The Mother of Eels has ears in every rivulet, and I have bartered for her patience with bone and breath; she will keep the eel packs away from your shadow if you keep your shadow kind. There are songs that only climb, and you have one of them in your hands now, so treat each note like a rung carved from trust. When the final chord comes, I will pull the tide taut like a bed-sheet and lay it smooth, and in that hush you will know it is safe to let go and come back to us. And if fear comes up to gnaw at your hands, spit it into the water and I will drown it for you by name.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"11A\", \"title\": \"Dusk Ascent on the First Hum\", \"text\": \"Sere gathers the team at the basalt foot when the chain’s out-of-season murmur first ripples the air like a cat’s purr, committing to climb at dusk when light is thin but not yet treacherous. She orders the eel-skin coil double-looped and has Sela read the flag-talk of gusts while Jaxin primes the stormglass to sing one breath ahead of lightning. Vara wades to knee and then thigh in brine, setting a wide, low hymn that tucks the waves under the iron like obedient dogs. Sere tests the first handhold with the old Warden habit of tapping twice, then climbs as if each link were a promise she had made and now must keep. Above, the city smolders with lamp-light, and every glance downward is a reminder that this song is bigger than her lungs and older than her scars.\", \"outcome\": \"The dusk winds prove honest and the first three chords answer like well-loved strings, each pluck thinning the static growl in the clouds until thunder sounds like footsteps walking away. At the fourth link a cross-gust tries to pry Sere free, but Sela’s green-blue-green signal buys a heartbeat for Jaxin to murmur a correction and for Sere to lean into the shove with a grin that feels like defiance. Vara’s hymn rounds the rock, laps the barnacles, and turns a biting surge into a soft slap of foam, and even the sky swifts hold their nests steady as if they, too, were listening. The seventh chord lands clean, the Heartward Engine hears its name spoken gently, and Rhy’s unseen hands close the water gate on the final soft note like a mother easing a door. The backwash comes as a shiver that rattles teeth and singes the edge of Sere’s saint-glass buckler, but the bones of the city settle two measures toward sleep, the chain quiets to a contented hum, and word spreads across the ribs that a climber taught the sky to hush.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"11B\", \"title\": \"Midnight Stillwater and Ghost-Route\", \"text\": \"Sere chooses to wait for the tide’s slack midnight, when even gulls mutter and the Ferryman’s rumored stillness can turn the Nine Mouths into black glass. She consults Old Marr in a shadowed corner of the Pilots Lantern, tasting salt on his stories as he marks a ghost-route of wind above the links with knotted twine. Jaxin re-tunes the stormglass to hear smaller, quicker pulses, the kind that hide under loud thunder and only confess themselves to patient ears. Sela tests the rope for memory and warns of magnetic eddies that will lie about direction and try to erase compass-thought from muscle. Vara lights no lantern at all, trusting the glow fungus stitched in her cuffs and a breath-measured hymn to call the tide to heel without waking the river spirits who distrust iron at night.\", \"outcome\": \"The midnight air is so still that Sere can hear the Engine’s far heartbeat through the links, and the first two chords drop like pebbles into a mirrored pond. Then the chain’s old magnetism sighs awake and twists the hum, and Jaxin’s lenses show a wobble that forces Sere to hold one pluck longer than planned while Sela curses in old pilot cant meant to divert bad luck. A barnacle ogre stirs under the lowest links, but Vara’s hush rocks it back to sleep like a lullaby given to a monster that only wanted a mother, and the climb resumes with new care. The seventh note finds its seat a hair late but perfectly tuned, and down in the Engine rooms Rhy closes the gate with hands that do not tremble. The city’s bones quiet as intended, the chain’s glow fades to a rested coal, and in the morning the Pilots Conclave claims they felt the hush first while the Salt Parliament takes credit for allowing such a dangerous rite, leaving Sere with success in her hands and politics nibbling at her heels.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"11C\", \"title\": \"Smuggler’s Ladders and Hidden Lenses\", \"text\": \"Sere calls in a debt to Keth of the Nets for a rung ladder bolted under the promontory and a stolen Collegium prism lens rumored to read the chain’s hum like color poured in a basin. She hates the taste of the favor but drinks it anyway, because speed and a sure anchor promise fewer widows if the storm turns spiteful. Jaxin eyes the borrowed lens with both curiosity and guilt, but he sets it true, and Sela posts two Black Net lookouts with signal flags where Wardens cannot see them. Vara dislikes the shadowed company but agrees to sing over any missteps and takes a lock of Sere’s red thread to bind into her hymn in case old debts wake sharks. They climb at first light, when the chain is cold as truth and the city has not yet chosen its lies for the day.\", \"outcome\": \"The hidden ladder buys a precious margin at the second and third links, and the prism lens catches a discord before it blooms into danger, letting Sere adjust the fourth chord with a breath to spare. Lightning stalks them like a cat but never pounces, teased aside by timed notes and Sela’s profane encouragements, and Vara’s song keeps the water docile enough to lick rocks instead of bite. The seventh pluck lands with surgical gentleness, Rhy seals the Engine’s gate on a final whisper, and the city’s long, anxious singing falls back two measures toward its bed. Word spreads faster than foam that the deed is done, but rumor is a fisher that always throws back truth: some say the Black Net delivered the sky to heel for coin, and some say a former Warden bartered safety with thieves. Marshal Isera’s watchers make a note in their ledgers while the Tidemothers give thanks without smiles, Keth smiles like a cut and asks only for a future conversation, and Sere walks away with the rope’s hum in her hands and a quiet chain in her wake.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"6\", \"7\", \"9\", \"10\"], \"next\": [\"12\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"City State\", \"description\": \"The chain quiets and the Heartward Engine’s pulse settles two measures toward sleep, granting Marrowgate a deeper calm and fewer panic-songs in the ribs.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"A length of storm-tempered rope that hums softly when pressure shifts dangerously, warning of sudden gusts, treacherous waves, or a chain ready to sing again.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Renown\", \"description\": \"Esteem across guilds as the climber who taught the sky a lullaby, opening doors among Pilots, Tidemothers, Bonewrights, and even grudging Wardens.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
