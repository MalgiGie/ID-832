The cairn stands ringed by weeds silvered with salt, its entrance a mouth of shadow rimmed with glass-bright chalk scratches where previous pilgrims traced crowns and prayers, and the air smells of rain that has not yet chosen a shore. Sere Kallin climbs with her eel-skin coil looped at the waist and a saint-glass buckler catching bruised light, feeling the old hum in her ribs answer the wind-harp tones as if the Heartward Engine were listening through her bones. Below, reed country darkens to ink and the Nine Mouths glimmer with net-lanterns, each a drifting star that believes in food and home; above, the Skyhook Chain is a black rib of iron across the reddening west, waiting for thunder like a lover waiting for a letter. The cairn sings a run of notes that step from soft to sharp, and in those intervals words appear, not spoken but carved by breath into Sere’s skin, syllables shaped like the names of living people who vote with colored brine and call it law. Whispers stir among the chalk stacks, rustling as if a crown of slate were being tried on by a wind that cannot bear its own weight, and spite-haunts show themselves only as colder patches where the notes bend, promising quick rain if someone will wear what they offer and naming prices that sound like favors until the last sentence makes them oaths. Old coins wink from crevices like drowned eyes, and the chalk dust carries a bitter tang like tears; somewhere within, a hidden chamber sighs and the wind-harps fall into cadence with a low river chant that Sere knows from waking at the Heartward Engine in red-pulse nights. Holl Riverborn’s instructions sit in her mind like stones in a sling, and Yasma Brine’s demand for proof weighs the other hand, because what is gathered here will not be only music but leverage, and leverage in Marrowgate is another word for tides. The eel codex tucked in Sere’s pouch is a ledger of currents, a priestly counterpoint to the Parliament’s hue-votes, and if the wind’s music can be notated beside it, then patterns may surface like sandbanks at low water, pointing to which basin councilors have been chosen by the storm to play roles they did not audition for. The choice will not be whether the wind speaks, because the wind always speaks to those who listen, but what to do with what it says, and who will carry that weather into the city built in a sleeping giant’s ribs.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Reach the Cairn of the Hollow King at dusk and record the wind-harp phrases.\",\n        \"Resist the bargains of the spite-haunts and retrieve a chalk rubbing of crown sigils.\",\n        \"Compare the sung names with Parliament rosters to identify those marked by the storm.\",\n        \"Decide what to tell Yasma Brine about the cairn’s accusations.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Holl Riverborn\", \"lines\": \"Do not wear iron into the cairn if you can help it, Sere, because the south wind here is older than our temples and remembers what metal did to its music when tyrants hammered thunder into chain. Kneel when the first long note rises and keep your gaze on the chalk until the second falls, for the spite-haunts hunger for eyes the way eels hunger for light, and they will hook you with a look if you let them. If they bargain, answer them with silence and breath through your nose, because silence is a net and your breath is a bell the river will hear if you need me; they will offer you crowns that fit your head only while you drown. We seek names carved in tone and interval, not sovereignty or weather on demand, and the wind will respect the difference if you do. Bring me the phrases as you hear them, the chalk rubbings as you find them, and the tremor in your hand as witness; we will set them beside the eel codex and let water judge what men would twist.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sere Kallin\", \"lines\": \"I’ll leave the iron buckles in my pack and trust the bonebrace to hold, though the habit of armor chafes when I walk into voices that carry no bodies. I will listen until the wind forgets to lie and the notes quit their flirting with words, then I will write what remains after bravado has blown itself thin, because I have ferried too many promises to the grief-shores to mistake a bargain for a blessing. If a haunt leans close, it will find only the shine of my buckler and the river’s patience, and I will not lend my name to any crown that needs drowning to sit. I will bring you sigils rubbed until my fingers whiten, and I will bring back the names as the wind speaks them, not as fear would polish them or ambition would sand them smooth. And when Yasma Brine asks for the storm’s gossip like it were another market tally, I will choose words as if choosing channels in flood, for I know what happens when a skiff commits to the wrong mouth.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yasma Brine\", \"lines\": \"Wind can be bribed with heat, flattery, and the boast of a dry roof, but it stays only where song is strong, and I do not tremble for drafts or for singers who died for rain. If it speaks my name, tell it to come to the Third Basin where old women weigh coin against grain and where debts wade out to our knees before we notice they have soaked our skirts, because I will pay no tithe to a cairn that does not haul a bucket. Bring me whatever music you find, and I will set it against the market’s mood, the price of salt, and the way the docks smell before a storm, for a city must eat while it argues with its gods. If I must stand in a storm to keep bread from going to war with salt, I will stand and I will not blink, but I will choose which storm and on which day because that is the privilege of those who have kept accounts longer than the wind has kept grudges. Do not mistake a list of names for a verdict, river-girl; at best it is a weather report, and even those lie when the Skyhook hums at the wrong hour.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"A\", \"title\": \"Kneel to the music and take only what the wind freely gives\", \"text\": \"You kneel at the cairn’s lip as Holl taught, your saint-glass buckler laid flat to catch the last light, and you let your eyes rest on chalk while the first low note climbs like a tide over pebbles. You count heartbeats between the flutes’ breaths and record only what survives the counting, copying intervals as if they were channels and syllables as if they were sandbars, for you trust patience more than omen. You ignore the cold brush of a spite-haunt passing like a cloud’s shadow and you offer no bargain and make no boast, because you have learned that the river never hurries to those who shout at it. When the crown-sigil chamber yawns, you slide in with shoulders set and rub chalk over the carved circlets until the dust gathers in the grooves like spent prayer, taking impressions without prying the stone. You leave the cairn with pages that smell of brine and chalk and a sense that the wind has said what it meant without twisting your hearing, and you feel clean, as if the south had washed your eyes.\", \"outcome\": \"Holl receives your notations with a slow, satisfied nod, sets them beside the eel codex, and hums as patterns emerge like hidden channels at low water, revealing three councilors whose names the storm favors when pressure dips. The Ossuary Archive grants you quiet respect, because you have brought tones without teeth, and Scribe Nalea whispers that the drowned books approve the rhythm of your restraint. Yasma Brine hears every syllable you recorded, frowns at two names, and thanks you in a way that adds a favor to your ledger rather than a knife to your back, promising to weigh the weather before she moves a vote. Word spreads among the Wardens that you walked the cairn without flinching or bargaining, and Marshal Isera’s suspicion softens by a thumb’s width, perhaps enough to open a door later. The spite-haunts hiss your name less and the wind keeps it, not out of malice but because it heard you listening; in nights to come, your stormglass whistle sings true, unwarped by whispers.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"B\", \"title\": \"Bargain with the spite-haunts for deeper secrets\", \"text\": \"You lift your head as the flutes shiver and meet the cold in the dark with your gaze steady, daring the spite-haunts to step closer until the air ripples like heat over salt pans. You speak not with words but with a slow exhale, shaping a question with breath and a promise to remember what they say, and you feel their attention rake you like reeds scraping a hull. They offer you a crown of chalk that will not weigh until rain falls and a list of names the wind will not sing aloud for fear of waking old vows; the price they name is small and heavy, the memory of the first order you disobeyed as a Warden. You think of debts that already breathe against your neck and decide you can spare one little shard, because shards are what the city gives and takes in equal measure. You accept carefully, take the deeper list and a pattern hidden in the crown sigils, and you leave with a chill under your skin that feels like someone else’s patience waiting to be spent.\", \"outcome\": \"Holl’s face tightens as he reads the names that were not sung, and he draws a sigil of warding in the chalk dust that clings to your fingers, warning that bargains make bridges but also traps, and that the river toll will be paid when the water is high. The Ossuary Archive takes your pages into a locked reading room lit by glow fungus, and drowned books whisper approvingly and then fall silent as if chewing on the price you paid, while Scribe Nalea marks a page with your token for restricted access. Yasma Brine looks at the added names with a gaze like a knife slid under a rope, and she smiles because leverage has ripened, promising coin and protection for your discretion, yet you feel the Ferryman token grow colder as if your next crossing will not be free. Keth of the Nets hears, by ways he always hears, that you trafficked in whispers that don’t belong to markets, and he offers to buy them from you with a resin of favors that smells sweet and sticks for years. At night the wind finds your window and murmurs the memory you traded, which will not come when you call it again, and you realize you have opened a door in the cairn that will stay ajar until you choose to shut it with a sacrifice.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C\", \"title\": \"Defy the cairn’s rites and force clarity with saint-glass and iron\", \"text\": \"You keep your iron buckles and set your saint-glass buckler upright, angling its lens to split the twilight and scatter it across the flutes, because you are tired of riddles and salt-slick veils. The music shivers, cracks, and then recomposes itself under the glare, and you stride into the ring with your chin up, daring the old wind to carry a tune without hiding knives in the rests. The spite-haunts recoil, hiss, and retreat into vents like eels avoiding a lantern, and for a moment the notes cease their flirtation with words and speak plain, each syllable as sharp as a cut from the Saint of Cuts. You take your rubbings fast, chalk dust turning to paste on your fingers, and you catch two names with certainty before the wind claws the light away and drowns the rest in a bruised roar. You leave with pages of partial truth and the smell of hot glass in your nose, feeling that you won something and lost something you won’t recognize until it matters.\", \"outcome\": \"Holl’s reprimand is quiet and long, a slow river wearing stone, and though he cannot deny the two clear names you bring, he warns that the cairn will remember your glare and answer you with storms that do not respect schedules. The Ossuary Archive files your notes with a caution mark, granting access to the alcove but only under watch, because your method scorched more than it lit, and Brother Holl’s presence is required when you consult the cairn recordings. Yasma Brine appreciates the certainty of the two names like a miser appreciates exact weights, but she knows the gaps as well as the figures, and she makes you swear by brine that you will not use iron near sacred posts again if you want her coin, binding you to a political etiquette that chafes. The Wardens hear that you strode into an old song with your armor on, and some cheer your boldness while the Temple frowns; your standing shifts like a barge at a wake, half-admired and half-distrusted. The spite-haunts remember the glare of saint-glass and begin to mimic your voice in alley gusts, trying to spend your words in your absence, and you will find yourself correcting lies that sound exactly like things you would say when angry.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"4\", \"6\", \"7\"], \"next\": [\"9\", \"10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"A wind-harp charm tuned to dampen spite-haunt whispers for a short time, a small bone flute-ring that, when breathed through, steadies a listener’s mind against cold drafts and bargaining murmurs.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Information\", \"description\": \"A list of marked councilors whose votes will tilt during weather shifts, gleaned from the cairn’s sung names and cross-checked against Parliament rosters to forecast how storms bend decisions.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Permission to access a sealed alcove in the Ossuary Archive with cairn recordings, allowing you to study wind-harp notations beside the eel codex under watchful lamplight.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
