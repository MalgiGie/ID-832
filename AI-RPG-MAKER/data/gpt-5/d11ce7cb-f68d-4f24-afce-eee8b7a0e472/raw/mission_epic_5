Vara Rootlight, lantern hooded and braid hung with wet shells that chimed like patient clocks, guides Sere Kallin along black roots veined with bioluminescent fungus that paints constellations into the floodwater and starlight under the canopy. Bone eels thread themselves into chandeliers above the channels, their teeth catching ghostfire the way temples catch vows; between their nests the children skip flat stones, clap odd patterns, and sing in measures of bubble and bone. Their play songs map currents that do not appear on any chart, counting pauses between the river’s heartbeats, turning silence into grammar and back into song. Vara believes the Mother of Eels has placed a provisional tongue into small mouths, teaching them the syntax of a channel not yet born, a tenth mouth written in future water. If Sere can earn a favor at the root shrine when the tide goes slack and listening is easiest, the eels may reveal a chant that answers to hush and hush alone, a verse that can open what storms have only hinted at.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Follow Vara Rootlight into the Gloomroot Mangroves and reach the root shrine at high slack tide, keeping steps soft so the chandelier eels do not scatter.\",\n        \"Observe the children’s games and record the cadence of their invented language, noting how claps, breaths, and pauses mirror the river’s slow pulse.\",\n        \"Offer bone and honest memory at the root shrine to draw the Mother of Eels’ attention, without gilding truth or hiding shame.\",\n        \"Translate the chant with Vara and test a safe verse on the river to see what moves, ensuring the water is washed with clean brine first.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Vara Rootlight\", \"lines\": \"Listen with your feet as well as your ears, Sere; the roots carry gossip better than any bazaar, and they will tell us when we stride like thieves or walk like kin. The mud remembers every step you have lied about taking, and it squeezes back when you pretend your weight is lighter than your debts. The children are not cursed; they are rehearsing, and play is the only classroom that water will tolerate without flooding the desks. I can hear counting in their song, a way of numbering the pauses between heartbeats of the water, a patient arithmetic that adds up to a mouth not yet drawn. If we are gentle, the Mother of Eels will let us copy a single line of her prayer, and she will let the line live outside these shadows long enough to be useful. If we posture or bargain as if a shrine were a stall, she will make a cradle of her teeth around us and rock us under until our names slough away. Remember, Tide-Mother rites are ropes, not cages; hold them taut and you’ll cross, but yank and you’ll drown. When the tide turns quiet, keep your breath smaller than a candle flame and your pride smaller still.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sere Kallin\", \"lines\": \"I have no wish to be anyone’s tooth, no matter how shining the smile, and I have fewer wishes left for being anyone’s lie. The Engine stuttered when the Skyhook Chain hummed last monsoon, and the river hates a forcing hand more than any guild hates a rival; if we prize a door open before the hinges are grown, it will slam on all our wrists. I will give a memory she can keep, one that aches clean, and ask only for a word I can carry without letting it bite through the pocket. My Ferryman token grows cold around unanswered questions, and I swear by its chill that I will stop if it freezes my palm; a closed mouth can save a city the way an open one can drown it. I’ll keep my buckler low, my pike grounded, and my temper stilled; if something must be sharp today, let it be the listening. And if the children’s games mark channels that don’t yet exist, I will step where their claps point and nowhere else, even if the path looks like air.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Holl Riverborn\", \"lines\": \"If you bring a prayer out of the mangroves, wash it in clean brine before you try it upon the open river, or the chant will drag home like a lost eel and sulk in your nets. Spirits hate the stink of being taken from the smell of their home, and they trip petitioners who run too fast with new toys, the way a wet rope coils around a fool’s ankle. Not all mouths are for eating; some are for singing, and some are for silence, and the river prefers you know which is which before you put your fingers between its teeth. Keep iron away from the verse and keep boasting out of your throat, for both make poor couplings with sacred water. And Sere, if the water changes shape under you, do not be brave in the way that means stubborn; be brave in the way that means wise, and step back before you step through. Bring me a copy carved in bone rather than scratched in glass, and I will match its pauses to our depth songs and see what storms it refuses.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mother of Eels\", \"lines\": \"Little fire-walker with a tremor like rain on a still pool, you bring me a shard of yourself and hold it up as if it were a lantern, and I am amused by the courage of such small heat. Your memory tastes of red water and of a girl who ferried panic and promise in the same skiff; it is honest enough to keep and soft enough to fold into the silt. My children learn the grammar of tomorrow because tomorrow is already pressing its teeth through the mud, and I will not have it arrive without a lullaby. Take one line, only one, and do not cut it shorter than it was given; names lose fingers when shortened by greed. Wash it in brine that has known no iron, teach it to your breath before you teach it to your tongue, and never sing it to wakefulness on a river that is angry. If you barter it for coin, the chant will chew the coin and your pockets both, and you will walk home dripping bright shame. Go soft, mouth-bearer; go soft and the tenth mouth will open as a yawn, not as a bite.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Offer a truthful memory and a carved bone at the root shrine\", \"text\": \"Sere kneels at the shrine with the river-chill running along her spine and lays a small scapula token she carved on the way in, its surface smoothed by anxious thumbs. She exhales the red-tide night she has always carried in pieces: the burning lens-light, the taste of iron, the baby swaddled in nets and the old man refusing to leave his eels. Her voice does not boast or beg; it simply remembers without ornament, and in the remembering she feels the mud stop judging and begin to listen. Vara’s hand remains a respectful distance from Sere’s shoulder, a presence rather than a guide, and even the bone eels above unlace their chandeliers by a degree. The children’s clapping game slows to match her story’s cadence, and the fungus constellations tremble like breath caught before a vow.\", \"outcome\": \"The roots loosen in a circle the way a throat relaxes to accept water, and the shrine answers with a hush shaped like a syllable. A single line of chant settles in Sere’s chest like a steadying weight, not a burden but a ballast, and Vara murmurs the transliteration into bone-script before its edges blur. Holl’s counsel proves wise; after washing the new prayer in clean brine, Sere and Vara test a verse on a slack eddy and watch a stubborn whirl turn aside as if persuaded by courtesy rather than commanded by force. No eels bite, no tides surge, and a reed-village elder who witnessed the offering from a hidden skiff steps forward to clasp Sere’s forearm and call her kin enough to hide in times of trouble. The root shrine keeps the memory, the river keeps its temper, and the tenth mouth keeps its patience, waiting to be asked again in the right voice.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Echo the children’s cadence to coax the channel before the rite is complete\", \"text\": \"Impatience pricks like glass grit under a bandage, and Sere hears in the children’s clap-song a lever placed within reach. She taps her buckler rim to their rhythm, letting the saint-glass scatter pale green echoes through the fungus glow, and for a breath the river seems to sync to her instead of her to it. Vara hisses a warning but does not break the pattern; she wants to see if the water will lean toward boldness or punish it. The Mother’s silence becomes heavy as a gaze, and the chandeliers of bone eels swing with a slow sway that feels like the city breathing in. Sere slides one final beat into the pattern, a gentle question rather than a shove, hoping that a respectful curiosity can do the work of a formal prayer.\", \"outcome\": \"The mangrove path shifts two finger-breadths to starboard, enough to send a hidden silt-shelf gliding out from under a tangle and reveal a safe passage as thin as a whisper. A tide-surge pricks its ears somewhere deeper in the Gloomroot, but the wave chooses a different aisle to thunder down, grumbling instead of roaring; the water does not punish, but it does nudge. Vara catches her breath and scolds Sere with relief still in it, insisting the verse be washed in clean brine before any further use, and the ritual is completed with a bow rather than a bruise. The test on open water later is successful yet conspicuous, drawing the curious eyes of a Warden skiff and the careful attention of a pilot apprentice who will surely speak to Old Marr. The rewards come as promised, but word spreads like fog over warm water, and future uses of the chant may need the cover of reed-village friends or the quiet hours before dawn.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bargain for secrecy by invoking a Black Net rung to test the verse unseen\", \"text\": \"Sere traces the hidden sigil woven into her eel-skin coil and remembers a rung ladder Keth of the Nets once whispered about, a shadow path that threads roots where Warden eyes never land. She speaks aloud—not the chant, but an old marker’s greeting that promises no coin and asks no coin, a truce phrase that smugglers respect more than law. Vara’s jaw tightens at the scent of market on holy ground, yet she watches, ready to break the plan if it bites too deep. A skiff’s shape unhooks from the mangrove’s reflections, and a reed-village elder with eyes like polished driftwood offers to ferry them to a testing pool where the water’s surface is a sheet of listening. Sere binds the bargain with a promise fit for a shrine, not a stall: no verse leaves this pool until it has been washed and weighed, and no name is traded for a path.\", \"outcome\": \"The hidden pool accepts the chant like a host who knows your parents, and the slack water bows into a corridor that only polite feet could notice, a mouth that opens to a hum rather than a shout. The elder laughs softly, a sound like oars dipping, and declares Sere welcome to hide a skiff among these roots on dark nights when the Wardens’ lanterns burn hot and unwise. The Black Net’s shadow does not thicken here; the elder places village above syndicate, and Keth’s rung gains Sere no debt beyond the old greeting. Vara relaxes enough to copy the verse into bone with her careful hand, and the two of them wash the words until even the fungus light approves. The rewards fall into Sere’s hands like cool stones, and only the knowledge remains that secrecy is a net with holes that shift; someday, she may have to choose again between quiet routes and loud obligations.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"4\"], \"next\": [\"6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Rite\", \"description\": \"A transliterated chant in bone-script that influences slack water for a short time, a single line taught by the Mother of Eels that coaxes eddies and hushes small surges when washed in clean brine and spoken gently.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"A vial of glow fungus gathered from the root shrine that brightens when spoken to in the eel-children’s cadence, answering pauses with soft light to mark safe steps or signal patient allies.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Ally\", \"description\": \"Friendship with a reed village elder who can hide a skiff among roots on request, folding hull and oar into mangrove shadow so Wardens and raiders alike will pass by as if the boat were a patch of moonlight.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
