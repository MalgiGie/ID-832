    "description": "The Anchor Fields are nine fortresses hammered into earth and ritual, and today the service towns hum like a fairground and an armory at once. Hark Tamsin, a steppe fixer with inked windroads on his forearms, has arranged escorts and timing with thunderherd clans who will not like what they have to like if Ankharion is to move. The plan: test a partial release at Anchor Three during the coming Crown of Cirrus event, when the wind wears a wedding veil. Chainwarden militias drill in the basins, Aerarium clerks tally counterweights with eyes like scales, and Night Orchid shadows assess who will profit from what. Lyris must deliver the rods, convince Arch-Warden Mael Iqiren to allow a controlled test, and unmask saboteurs who would rather see a catastrophe prove their point than a measured success prove them wrong.",
