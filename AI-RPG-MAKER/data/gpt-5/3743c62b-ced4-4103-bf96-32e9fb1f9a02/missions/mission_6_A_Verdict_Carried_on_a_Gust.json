    "description": "The Wind Court rises like a net woven from law and weather. Saela Morn, an advocate who keeps her hair braided like a rope she can climb out of an argument with, asks for proof and protection. The Court will hear a motion to cap Aerarium tariffs in poor harvest years, and the verdict bell will only bind if the wind carries its note to three corners. Night Orchids have chimes to bend eddies; some serve Matron Vessa, some serve only themselves. Lyris must walk the amphitheater’s under-stairs with a set of true-notes and the courage to use them, deliver the ledger evidence from the Aerarium’s secret credit line to the bench, and keep the wind honest without getting her pendant confiscated or her throat cut.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Saela Morn at the Wind Court and receive a sealed packet detailing the Aerarium’s secret credit line with the High Tithe Syndic.",
        "Plant true-note chimes in the Court’s lower vents to counter illicit eddy-benders.",
        "Deliver the sealed packet to the presiding judge’s clerk without Night Orchid interception.",
        "Time your pendant chime to ensure the verdict bell’s note carries to three corners.",
        "Exit via the signal vane ladders before Chainwarden marshals close the gates."

If we prove the Aerarium purchased famine to sell light, we must be sure the bell does not stutter on its way to a corner that favors their purse."
