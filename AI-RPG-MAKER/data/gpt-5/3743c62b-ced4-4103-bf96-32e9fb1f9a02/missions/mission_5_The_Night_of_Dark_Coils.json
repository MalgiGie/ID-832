    "description": "The Lantern Yards’ sheds glow like low suns, copper spires hissing, while the city’s shadows crowd beneath. Greydin Korr, a foreman with burned hands and a gentler voice than his jaw suggests, needs a condenser coil moved under the Mirefurl Docks before the Syndic’s tariff squeeze cuts his night shift. Kesh runs escort on windroads below, blinking signal-lamps to whisperstone beats. Halfway there, Syndic press-gangers appear with reed-boat hooks and a letter of marque, and from the catwalk above comes the scent of orchids and a sound like the memory of a bell—Seresya Thorn and her rogue cell, eager to borrow the coil in exchange for future silence. Lyris must keep the coil alive without letting it become a weapon against the city she is trying to save.",
    "objectives": [
        "Collect the condenser coil from Greydin Korr at the Lantern Yards and secure it with cloudfruit lines.",
        "Coordinate with Kesh Storm-Runner via whisperstone for ground-level diversions.",
        "Repel a press-gang attempt by Syndic hires near Mirefurl Tower Two without escalating to lethal force.",
        "Decide whether to allow Seresya Thorn to copy the coil’s plating pattern on-site or deny Orchid interference entirely.",
        "Deliver the coil to the hidden berth near Mirefurl Tower Three and confirm Greydin’s receipt."

        {
            "speaker": "Seresya Thorn",
            "lines": "Do not mistake me for charity. I will not take the coil, I will only look at it until my eyes remember the plates. My Matron wants a sketch, and I would rather draw than bleed. But if you say no, I will not ask twice, and the next thing that knows your name will be a chime."

        {
            "speaker": "Kesh Storm-Runner",
            "lines": "Press-gangers ahead. Two boats, one flag, three men who cannot strike straight when the wind is cross. Give me a whistle and I’ll wrap them in reeds like fish. I’d rather not spill blood for a tariff written by a man who has never slept in a barn during a lightning squall."
