    "description": "The Wind Court fills with lantern light and sharp breaths. The Skyscribes spool charts across the dais, Mirror Guild apprentices bring lenses wrapped like swaddled infants, and Chainwardens stand with hands clasped as if to keep the city from leaving their fingers. Saela Morn asks Lyris to do what the city has not done in three centuries: speak the truth about motion without letting it be chained or set on fire. Matron Vessa sits in the shade, eyes like the polished backs of beetles, calculating a price for silence; Arch-Warden Mael stands with a mouth that has forgotten how to smile and a heart that maybe remembers how. The Sailor of the Ninth Knot’s voice comes again from nobody and everywhere, and Lyris must choose where to lay the ten-step page: in the Archives under oath, in the market under sun, or in her cloak hem, where secrets sleep and sometimes wake.",
    "objectives": [
        "Compile the proof-of-concept data, ten-knot fragments, and safety protocols into a single dossier.",
        "Present the dossier in the Wind Court with Saela Morn’s advocacy, timing statements with forecasted gusts.",
        "Negotiate terms with Arch-Warden Mael to establish regulated 'Voyage Hours' for future partial unmoorings.",
        "Confront Matron Vessa Greye and settle outstanding debts in exchange for limiting Orchid interference.",
        "Deposit a sealed copy of the ten-step calculus page into the Torsion Archives under a new oathbinding that protects against unilateral use."

If we promise to move only when the city consents, if we promise to stop when she flinches, then we can write a future that doesn’t break anyone’s back. Speak for the wind as if it were a person who will remember what you said when you meet again in a storm."

We will move when the city is ready and stop when she is not, and anyone who tries to sell that stopping will learn how patient the wind can be when it chooses its debts. I have loved this city long enough to let it leave me, a little, and come back."
