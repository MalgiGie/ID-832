    "description": "The Sky Orchard drifts in a lazy gyre, and Ovelle Kite moves along vines like a bell clapper through the city’s throat. Silver leaves flash, cloudfruit pods sway, and Aerarium quotas hang like stormweight on every farmer’s shoulder. Ovelle knows where the Gardeners of the Air might accept a ribbon and where they will snatch a fool into the mist. You must harvest pods tuned to buoy heavy lines and retrieve aerolith-bearing root nodules before masked Aerarium assessors count you short. Mira Pellan, an Aerarium auditor with a keen ear for false chits, watches the vine-bridges with a ledger tucked under her arm and a promise to Prefect Lalei Vitt to stop leaks before they become rivers. Lyris’s glide harness and forged papers will be tested against honest wind.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Ovelle Kite at the Orchard’s leeward tether and learn the day’s windroads.",
        "Harvest three mature cloudfruit pods without cutting living vines on a fog day and offer a ribbon at the Gardeners’ shrine.",
        "Unearth two aerolith-bearing root nodules and hide them among legitimate baskets bound for the Aerarium.",
        "Outmaneuver Mira Pellan’s inspection by presenting forged chits and a plausible harvest route, or negotiate a reduced levy.",
        "Deliver the pods and nodules to an Unmoored cache netted beneath a vine-bridge without provoking Aerarium seizure."
