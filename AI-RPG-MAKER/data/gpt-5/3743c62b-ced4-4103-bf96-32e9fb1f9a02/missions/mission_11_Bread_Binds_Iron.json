    "description": "The High Tithe Syndic feels the city move and tightens his fist around the river’s throat. Grain convoys halt, prices turn brittle, and the Sky Market’s laughter goes thin. Kesh brings Lyris a whisperstone message: the Syndic will talk if the city admits it needs bread more than it needs dreams. Mira Pellan waits at a reed-fringed dock with a briefcase of promises and a face that looks tired of moral arithmetic. Hark Tamsin has arranged a windroad through delta fog to the Syndic’s stilt hall, where the floorboards creak like a lie in an empty room. To keep Ankharion fed and the tests continuing, Lyris must bargain with a man who thinks a ledger outlives love.",

You will release barges on a schedule tied to audits signed by men who count bolts, not beans. Or the Wind Court hears a bell that carries to three corners and a delta besides."
