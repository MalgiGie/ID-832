    "description": "On a windless night the Hinge bell in the Chain Cathedral tolled by itself, and Ankharion held its breath. Lyris feels the note shiver in her bones as the Old Song catches on a discord, pulling memory through fresh worry. Yassa Nim waits beneath the Knotfast Commons’ black-cord pole where apprentices tie silent allegiances; the bells here do not ring for the unspoken. Yassa has ink on her fingers and grease on her sleeves—the mark of someone who has crossed a lot of lines without ever leaving a trail. She says an oath was broken in the Cathedral’s nave, and an Orchid runner never returned from a simple page-swap. To find what started the bell, Lyris must slip into the Chain Cathedral, pry loose a hidden ledger slip, and read its ghost-scratches with skyglass before Matron Vessa demands proof or a body. The city hums and the chains sway, and in Lyris’s chest the thought returns: the last time she broke a promise, the Hinge rang for her too.",

That means an oath bound in the nave snapped like a frayed cord, and when that happens, the city listens. I sent a boy to fetch me a line from the oath ledger—routine, quiet, a page in a sea of pages—and he did not come back. Bring me the line and its meaning, and I will strike your name from one corner of Matron Vessa’s ledger. Fail me, and she will write your name deeper."

You were almost a good apprentice once. Almost. Walk light, and if I see you under the Hinge, I’ll carry you out by the scruff of your cloak and make the bell sing your name."
