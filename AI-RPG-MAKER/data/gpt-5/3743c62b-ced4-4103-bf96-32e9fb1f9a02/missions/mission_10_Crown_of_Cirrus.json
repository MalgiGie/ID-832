    "description": "The Crown of Cirrus takes seven minutes to pass a city’s brow, and Lyris feels every second like a bead on a rosary of risk. Kites rise from rooftops to read the veil; the Old Song swells as Anchor Three’s capstans turn; and the crowd’s breath braids with the wind. The Sailor of the Ninth Knot speaks through a brass voice-pipe from nowhere anyone can point to, giving calm instructions in a voice like a tide. Ovelle’s teams dance along tethers with cloudfruit cords in their teeth; Kesh counts lightning to place the thunderherd away from a surge; Istel watches lens flicker for the first sign of a storm-eel curve in the math. Arch-Warden Mael’s hand never leaves the emergency brake. And then the ten-knot curve wakes under Lyris’s fingers, a hum that is also a chord, and the city moves, a hair, a breath, a promise.",

        "Use the Cirrus Splitter Lens to monitor oscillations and signal Arch-Warden Mael for micro-pauses.",
        "Ride out the induced yaw by redistributing lift via aerolith nodules and cloudfruit cords along the test chain.",
        "Rebind the Nine Knots in their test configuration and confirm stabilization before the Crown passes."
