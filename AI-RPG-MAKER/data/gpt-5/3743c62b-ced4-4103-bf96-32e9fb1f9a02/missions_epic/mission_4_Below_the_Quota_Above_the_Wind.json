  "description": "The Sky Orchard drifts in a lazy gyre downwind of Ankharion, its verdant islets stitched together by vine-bridges, kites, and bright cords that hum like low harps in the mist. Silver-leafed boughs shiver as pods of cloudfruit swell and bob, each a patient promise of lift bound in living fiber and old rites. Aerarium quotas press like stormweight on the Orchard folk, their tally bells ticking in the fog while masked assessors stride the bridges and stamp chits that can turn a season harsh. Ovelle Kite moves along the vines as if the wind taught her steps, reading eddies with a glance, tying slipknots that respect sapflow, and tapping shrine bells to placate the unseen Gardeners of the Air. She asks Lyris Kael to harvest tuned pods without harming living vines on a fog day, to unearth two aerolith-bearing root nodules without leaving a scar the assessors can smell with their ledgers, and to ride a thread of plausible routes through an inspection Mira Pellan is sharpening like a mirror’s edge. The Unmoored have netted a cache beneath a vine-bridge where lanternlight seldom falls, and the delivery must happen without provoking seizure, scandal, or a gust that remembers the wrong name.",
