  "description": "The Sunken Atelier is a submerged lung that has learned to breathe in equations, exhaling mist that tastes faintly of copper and old vows. Basalt corridors sigh with the weight of ideas that bent the wind before Ankharion was named, and brass armatures bloom with rope geometry older than the city’s first mooring prayers. On fog nights the marsh turns to a choir and the frogs count in primes, a pulse that aligns with carved apertures and seals that refuse honest numbers. Erynn has traced the prime-chime to a tuning vault lined in crystalline rods and tarnishless brass plates, each etched in vectors that whisper a Tenth Knot the Chainwardens deny exists. Rul Fen, sent by Arch-Warden Mael Iqiren to bury what cannot be unsaid, stalks the same halls with orders to seize or sink anything that breathes the forbidden calculus. Water seeps through hairline fractures, numbers hum like a held breath, and the Old Song drifts thinly through the stone as if the city itself is listening. In that drowned geometry a choice drags at the heart: save a man who once bound your name to iron, or save the handful of rods that might unbind the city at last.",
  "objectives": [
    "Enter the Sunken Atelier via the marsh sluice identified on Istel’s map fragment.",
    "Solve the prime-counting frog puzzle to unlock a watertight door and access the tuning vault.",
    "Retrieve three crystalline tuning rods and two brass plates etched with unfamiliar ten-knot vectors.",
    "Encounter Rul Fen trapped under a collapsed beam; choose to free him or leave him to complete your extraction.",
    "Escape as floodwaters rise, using cloudfruit lines to lighten loads and reach the surface."

      "lines": "Listen for the primes, not the croaks, because the marsh has a mathematics of its own and it detests lies. The door will not answer to even counts or to pretty hymns from the Chain Cathedral; it answers only to the uneven breath between two truths. Hum with the frogs on the five, the seven, the eleven, and you will feel the bolts shrug like tired shoulders surrendering a secret. Take only rods whose cores ring clear when you touch your coin to them, because a cracked tune will teach your bones to ache and tell the vault you are a thief. The plates will look clean, but kiss one edge with your mirror coin and watch for the haze, because the honest vectors will drink the light and the forged will spit it back. Remember that water here is a scribe and it writes in patience, so keep your cloudfruit line ready to lift what the marsh tries to claim. If Rul Fen is in there—and the wind says he is—know that orders do not make monsters, but they do make men into anchors when the city cannot afford a sail. Bring me the rods and plates, and I will bind a silence around your name so even the Night Orchids must pay scent to part the cord."

      "lines": "The mud has a long memory, and it remembers apprentices who ran and the inspectors who let their names be sold like scrap. I told myself that signing you was a mercy at the time, a way to keep you in the safe catwalks instead of the tram couplings that bite, and I told the Hinge about it when no one listened. Orders brought me to this hole, and a wicked bit of geometry dropped this beam on me like a judge’s bell, so now we both have our truths pinned where they cannot wriggle. If you leave me, I will die under a math I never studied, and the Old Song will take my last breath for a chorus I do not deserve. If you lift this, I will owe you a debt that reaches further than any chain, and I will still try to do my duty after, because Mael Iqiren’s gaze is a vise and my oath is an iron rung in my spine. In my inner pocket there is a maintenance override token that can hush a veto bell once, and I did not bring it here to trade, but drowning narrows a man’s pride. If you choose the rods over me, take them fast and do not look back, because the frogs are counting down and the primes do not wait for guilt."

      "speaker": "Lyris Kael",
      "lines": "You etched my name into a contract like a rivet driven hot, and every time I pass the Chain Cathedral I hear the Hinge ring for things I promised in fear. I learned to time my breathing to the Old Song, but I learned to move between beats where the Night Orchids taught me to stitch silence, and in those seams I stopped being a child. The frogs here are kinder than most men, because at least they count true, and their primes do not ask for tithes or signatures in grease. I can lift this beam with a knot and a breath if I decide the ledger can hold one more crooked line, and I can leave it if the rods will turn that crooked line into a straight wind for everyone stuck beneath these chains. If I lift it, you go up and you do not follow, and if you do follow, you do not shout, and if you shout, I will mute you with the same chime you once waved over my head. If I leave you, I will remember the way your eyes look in this water, and I will make certain the plates I carry sing so loud that even Mael has to unclench his jaw to listen. Either way, the marsh is taking its due, and I will pay it in sweat or in sorrow, but not in silence."

      "lines": "Debts come in more flavors than coins and blood, little stormglass, and you already owe me in both, so let us talk about a debt called position. If you save a Chainwarden today, I will find a way to redirect the sharpened end of that favor into a throat that deserves it, and the Matron will smile like a knife wrapped in velvet. If you let the marsh archive his bones, we will call it an acceptable edit to the city’s ledger, but those edits ripple in the Wind Court where the Orchids do not always hold the bell. The frogs are counting you a path, and the primes are a clock with teeth, so do not confuse deliberation with drowning, because both feel slow until they do not. Remember that Arch-Warden Mael has eyes strung on cables across this city and he will pluck them like harps if his man goes missing, so weigh the rods in one hand and your routes in the other. Bring me the tuning rods and the plates, and I will erase the scent of your passage so thoroughly even the Skyscribes will blame a fickle gust. But if you come back with a Chainwarden hanging on your cord, I will make sure the only ringing you hear is an opportunity, not an alarm."

      "text": "You knot the cloudfruit line with practiced fingers, whispering the Orchard’s ribbon-rhyme as the cord drinks weight, and the beam grows light enough to argue with. Hook gloves bite the grain of old brass as you lever and breathe on the primes, matching the frogs at five, seven, and eleven until the vault’s echoes seem to help. Rul Fen gasps like a bellows punched through, and for a heartbeat the Old Song threads the marsh, a single clean note riding the mist. You see the man who stamped your name and the man whose hand grips yours, and the ledger between them wavers, ink bleeding into water in a pattern that might be mercy. The rods and plates clink against your chest in their oilcloth, a promise heavier than the beam ever was, and you feel the flood rise up your calves like a second decision coming due.",
      "outcome": "Rul Fen staggers but holds, pressing a cold token into your palm with a muttered apology that tastes like rivet dust and prayer, and he promises a silence that will get him flogged if it breaks. You lose a handful of breaths to the rescue, but you do not lose the rods or plates, and the frogs do not scold you for spending time on a life. At the first stairwell he peels away toward a service vent, jaw set like a cog, and you do not see him again until the city pretends not to notice the override you slip at a maintenance door. The Chainwardens search harder in the days that follow, but the report that reaches Mael describes a mishap, a fog, and an inventory of nothing, and the Matron files your new leverage under a velvet tab. Erynn’s eyes flick to the token and back to the rods, and she nods once, binding a hush that lets you walk past Orchid chimes and Skyscribe vans without a whisper catching on your heels."

      "title": "Let the Marsh Decide",
      "text": "You gauge the angle, the mired footing, and the rising sheet of black water, and you feel the ledger in your ribs align to a colder calculus. The prime chorus reaches thirteen and turns sharp, and in that stabbing interval you pivot, cinch the rods tight under your cloak, and put your breath where it will carry more than one future. Rul Fen reads your decision in the same way you read chain sway, and his nod is an ugly, honest thing that does not ask for forgiveness it has not earned. You do not speak because words drown faster than bodies, and the marsh does not care for speeches, so you run the vault’s rib like a catwalk and let the frogs mark your steps. The watertight door hisses open when you hum the next prime without shaking, and the pressure change slaps your ears like a judge sealing a case.",
      "outcome": "The escape is a clean, brutal thing measured in wet footfalls and the weight of rods that refuse to sing of regret, and no alarms follow you up the sluice. Yassa’s scent-trail is already cut when you surface, and her nod says the ledger balanced in her favor as well, which means your routes remain yours for a little longer. Erynn takes the plates with hands that tremble only after they are wrapped, and she lays a marsh blessing on your tools that beads water like shame off a lie. Rumors coil through Ankharion by dusk that a Chainwarden went missing where the frogs speak numbers, and the Collegium tightens inspections along the chainhouses in response. The Unmoored whisper you counted true when the city needed it, and the Wind Court’s gusts carry your name less often, which is its own kind of shelter even without a token to hush a veto bell."
