  "description": "On a windless night the Hinge bell in the Chain Cathedral tolled by itself, and Ankharion held its breath as if a city of stone remembered it could float. The Old Song faltered on a sour note that seemed to thread Lyris’s bones, tugging at every broken promise she had ever hidden under her whispercloak. Beneath the Knotfast Commons’ black-cord pole, where names are tied without being spoken and bells are forbidden to ring, Yassa Nim waits with ink-stained fingers and grease-smudged sleeves, the look of someone who has crossed a dozen lines and left only rumors standing in her footprints. She speaks of an oath snapped in the Cathedral’s nave, the kind recorded by an oath ledger whose pages are oiled like prayer and numbered like debts, and of an Orchid runner who went in for a simple page-swap and never came back to report his success or his ghost. The Chain Cathedral’s ribs groan softly in the stillness, and every rivet looks like an eye that knows exactly how many oaths Lyris has bent to keep people breathing and promises alive. To learn what woke the Hinge, Lyris must slip through choir scaffolds timed to hymns, kneel under the third nave bench two rivets shy of a broken-circle stamp without letting her heel touch the iron taboo, pry out a hidden ledger slip, and carry it like a live spark to the Sky Market where skyglass can coax truth out of soot and sweat. Istel Shardwright will read the ghost-scratches in farseeing light, but Matron Vessa has a ledger of her own and will demand proof, a culprit, or a body before the Night Orchids decide to balance their books in blood. The city’s chains sway as if remembering stories of sailing free, the Wind Court listens for an edict on the breeze, and Lyris feels the hush stretch tight enough that one more broken oath might snap the whole chord.",
