  "description": "The Shattersea’s eastern shelf has begun to sing in a register that turns breath to frost and makes lantern flames lean toward the water as if listening. Lenses ground from the vein’s plates show slivered futures and fogged regrets, and kites flown above the meltpool tug toward winds whose footsteps are still a valley away. At dawn, on a ledge slick with salt dew and flecked obsidian dust, Nalia Pree has arranged a covert parley where the cliff face reflects your face in a hundred ripples, each with a different weather behind your eyes. She asks you, Lyris Kael, to bring the Cirrus Splitter Lens and the tripod with the softwood pads, because the stone hum cracks hard feet and warps unblessed metal. Erynn Sythar arrives hooded like a contraband prayer, equations stitched into the hem of their cloak, and the air around them smells of rain on copper. The Mirror Queen is rumored to rise where reflections are most honest, and the shelf today feels like a courtroom of water where truth is not negotiated but weighed. You must align lens and kite to the angle markers Nalia has chalked, hold position as the hum peaks and the glass draws a ten-knot predictive curve like a silver thread through a black loom, and then decide how to split what you catch so no single faction sails the city by the throat. The quarry hoists creak as crews change shifts above, Skyscribes argue auguries with lenswrights at the rim, and somewhere in the obsidian a note sustains so pure it could slice a lie into ribbons.",
