  "description": "Shattersea mornings are knives and mirrors, and the obsidian shelves sing in thin voices when the cold meets the sun. Quarry taps tick like a metronome for the heart, and the meltpool breathes a thread of mist that climbs the still air like a vow. Istel Shardwright meets you on a wind-scoured ledge with a crate of grits—coarse for hunger, medium for patience, fine for truth—and a superstition carved into muscle memory about polishing only when the wind comes from the east. The Mirror Guild says truth refracts but does not vanish, yet the Skyscribes mutter that prediction without permission is a storm loosed in a courtroom. Between gust and glint, you will grind a lens able to read pressure-ghosts in ink and hesitation in the hand that wrote it, then carry that brightness through a mirror-portal without letting rivals decide whether truth is chained or burned.",
