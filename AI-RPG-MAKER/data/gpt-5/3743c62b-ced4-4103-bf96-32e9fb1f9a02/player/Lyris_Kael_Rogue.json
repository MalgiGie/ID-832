        "description": "Lean and quick with wind-browned skin, cropped black hair threaded with a single silver cord, and eyes the gray-blue of stormglass. Moves like a shadow along chain rails and ribbon-bridges, clothing cut to break up her outline beneath lantern light.",

    "class": "Rogue",
    "history": "Born in a chainhouse tenement beneath the groaning anchor-lines of Ankharion, Lyris grew up timing her steps to the Old Song of iron and wind. Her mother tied festival knots at the Knotfast Commons; her father mended tram harnesses until a tariff squeeze by the High Tithe Syndic sank the family into debt. As an eager apprentice, Lyris caught the eye of a Chainwarden inspector who bound her to a predatory maintenance contract—until Yassa Nim of the Night Orchids cut her cord in the dark, swapped the ledger page, and demanded a future favor. Trained in rooftop routes, scent-trails, and tuned chimes, Lyris became a courier between factions that never publicly meet. In the Sky Market’s lens quarter she befriended Istel Shardwright of the Mirror Guild, whose laugh at the Shattersea’s edge taught Lyris that truth refracts but does not vanish. On a lantern convoy skirting the Stormsteppe, she saved Kesh Storm-Runner—a thunderherd rider—from a press-gang raid sponsored by delta brokers; since then Kesh runs windroads for her when the city’s routes are watched. Lyris now runs black cords for the Unmoored, ferrying knot-calculus fragments copied from the Torsion Archives and moving cloudfruit-lift prototypes under Aerarium noses. She has stepped into the Chain Cathedral’s nave to swear oaths she intended to keep and then broke for the city's sake—hearing the Hinge ring on a windless night. With Crown of Cirrus omens rumored to return, she stands on the cusp of a plan that could loosen Ankharion’s chains without snapping them, if she can outpace the Chainwardens’ militias, the Aerarium’s accountants, and the Orchids’ ledgers.",
