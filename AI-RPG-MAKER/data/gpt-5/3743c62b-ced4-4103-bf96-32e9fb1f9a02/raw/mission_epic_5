"{\n  \"id\": \"5\",\n  \"title\": \"The Night of Dark Coils\",\n  \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Greydin Korr\", \"affiliation\": \"Lantern Yards\"},\n  \"description\": \"The Lantern Yards burn like patient stars along the city’s rim, copper spires humming while the lightning barns caged within crackle and sing to the Old Song of ratchets and wind. Greydin Korr, foreman and keeper of night shifts no edict dares to snuff, presses a wrapped condenser coil into Lyris’s arms, the metal warm and thrumming like a held breath. Above, Ankharion’s chainhouses moan in sympathy as carts cross ribbon-bridges and the Wind Court’s vanes click out new hours, while below the Stormsteppe answers with a black river glitter and far-off thunderbeast bells. Kesh Storm-Runner waits on the windroads with reed-woven decoys and a whisperstone tuned to Lyris’s voice, ready to turn Syndic eyes aside with the old clan arts of misdirection. But the Syndic’s press-gangers have letters of marque and hooks for lifting more than cargo, and from a catwalk where shadows gather like conspirators comes the chime-soft approach of Seresya Thorn, a Night Orchid rogue whose knives are quieter than her curiosity. Between tariff and chime, between ground and sky, Lyris must shepherd a coil that could keep lamps steady through the next gale without letting it become a blade at the city’s throat.\",\n  \"objectives\": [\"Collect the condenser coil from Greydin Korr at the Lantern Yards and secure it with cloudfruit lines.\", \"Coordinate with Kesh Storm-Runner via whisperstone for ground-level diversions.\", \"Repel a press-gang attempt by Syndic hires near Mirefurl Tower Two without escalating to lethal force.\", \"Decide whether to allow Seresya Thorn to copy the coil’s plating pattern on-site or deny Orchid interference entirely.\", \"Deliver the coil to the hidden berth near Mirefurl Tower Three and confirm Greydin’s receipt.\"],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Greydin Korr\", \"lines\": \"Storm-oil makes brave men stupid and careful men saints, and tonight I need saints with fast hands. This coil is the heart of a promise, the kind that keeps lanterns steady when the wind kicks sideways and children trace their letters in light instead of smoke. I have seen a barn of lightning go hungry and I have seen it overfeed, and either way the city learns to fear the dark again, so I will not let this piece of hope sit another hour in a ledger. I do not care for the Aerarium’s price whispers or the Syndic’s tariff sermons; iron has no patience for politics, only for torque and truth. Take it warm, keep it warm with those cloudfruit lines, and if anyone asks you for a toll tonight, tell them Greydin Korr paid already with the scar on his left hand and with every lamp that refused to flicker.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Seresya Thorn\", \"lines\": \"Do not mistake me for charity or for hunger; I am here for balance, and balance is a quiet word for leverage. I will not take the coil, I will only let my eyes drink its plates until memory holds a mirror of them, because my Matron values knowledge that arrives without screams. I bring no militia and no writ, only a chime that can teach an eddy to bend, and I would rather draw a pattern in the air than draw blood on the floor. But if you say no and slam the door, the sound you hear after will be a ledger closing, and ledgers sometimes close on fingers. Decide quickly and clearly, Lyris Kael, because even patience becomes a blade if you leave it too long in the dark.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Kesh Storm-Runner\", \"lines\": \"Press-gangers ahead, river-flag bright as a knife, and their reed-boat hooks glitter like fish bones in moonlight; I count two boats riding a shallow seam and one man blowing a whistle to a rhythm he does not understand. Give me your breath on the whisperstone and I will answer with a ghost herd, a thrum on the wind that will make them think thunderbeasts are turning in the channels. I would rather not spill a drop tonight for a tariff minted in a hall that never tastes storm, but I will tie their pride into knots and send them home embarrassed and whole. If they rush the pilings, I have nets soaked in river-sleep and a song to the reeds that will slow their arms without stopping their hearts. Keep to the catwalk’s left rail when I say so, because the gust that comes there has been my friend since I was a child who ran ahead of rain.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Lyris Kael\", \"lines\": \"No one bleeds tonight if I can help it, because blood stains cords and makes knots slip when you least expect it. Seresya, you will have a look if your chime stays quiet and your knives stay sheathed, and the only thing that leaves with you is breath that fogs and then disappears. Kesh, tune your ghost herd to the second beat, and when the press-gangers blink, I will move the coil past their eyes like a coin that knows its own reflection. Greydin, keep the core warm with your oath and with this cloudfruit line cinched at the shoulder, because if it goes cold, this becomes a sermon about principle instead of a delivery of light. I will walk the broken-circle rivets if I must for this, but the wind owes me a favor, and tonight I intend to spend it.\"}\n  ],\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Allow Seresya to sketch the plates under strict conditions\", \"text\": \"You mark a circle of worklight on the catwalk and make Seresya step inside, insisting that her chime remain muted and her assistants keep their hands visible while you count out a measured span. The coil is unwrapped only as far as the plating pattern requires, and you keep the core veiled in cloth warmed by your own breath and the cloudfruit line’s lift. You set a rule of five: five paces distance, five minutes of study, five questions answered in whispers that never leave this tier. The press-gangers’ whistles drift closer, so you pace the count with their confusion, turning danger into a metronome that moves everything forward without a stumble. The Night Orchid rogue sketching in her head nods to every limit you lay down, because she recognizes a fellow practitioner of controlled risk.\", \"outcome\": \"Seresya’s eyes drink the pattern and she leaves without touching the coil, payment expressed as a soft-chimed promise and a flat token pressed into your palm that smells faintly of crushed petals and iron. Word of your measured mercy moves through the Orchids’ shadow archive, softening doors that once slammed and teaching certain chimes to sing your name with less edge. The Chainwardens later grumble about rumors of illicit study but find no breach to pin on you, because the core stayed wrapped, warm, and unmarked by foreign hands. Kesh uses the minute you bought with ritual and rules to spring his reed-sleep nets, leaving the Syndic’s men coughing and cursing but unhurt, and you slip the coil past Mirefurl Tower Two like a whispered joke that everyone is relieved to forget. At Tower Three’s hidden berth, Greydin’s men receive the coil intact, and the lanterns over the tenement lanes burn steadier the next week, while your ledger gathers a Night Orchid leverage token you can spend when the city’s doors turn stubborn.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Deny all Orchid interference and force a clean corridor\", \"text\": \"You meet Seresya’s gaze and draw an invisible line on the catwalk with your boot, telling her that light for children weighs more than profit in any ledger worth keeping. You lower the coil’s canvas wrap only enough to prove you have it and then bind it tighter, knotting the cloudfruit line in a way that signals both resolve and readiness to run. When she tests your temper with a soft chime, you still the air with a raised hand and let the city’s Old Song carry your refusal in the iron beneath your feet. Kesh hears your decision in the stone and answers with a diversion brighter than a yes: a ghost herd drum and a lantern reflection that turns the press-gangers’ eyes inland. You move, fast and precise, choosing silence over bargain and trusting that respect earned without exchange can be as valuable as a token minted in perfume and threat.\", \"outcome\": \"Seresya watches you go and, after a long heartbeat, bows once like a duelist who will remember the feel of your stance more than the words you spoke. In the Night Orchids’ ledgers you are marked not as an enemy but as a boundary, and boundaries draw a different kind of respect that sometimes costs less in the end. The press-gangers lunge too late, caught by Kesh’s reed-sleep and the sudden attention of a patrol skiff you lured with a mirrored flash, and no blood falls to the boards. Greydin’s coil reaches the hidden berth warm and whole, and a rumor begins that the Lantern Yards have ghosts on their side, which is better than the truth in a city that listens to wind more than law. You gain no leverage token, but the grudging respect that follows you into the Sky Market buys silence in alleys where words usually come with prices and knives.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Offer a controlled glimpse through a mirror trick, leaving no memory to steal\", \"text\": \"You take out Istel’s mirror coin and tilt it to catch the coil’s plates, showing Seresya a refracted image that is true enough to tempt but slippery enough to deny detail. You explain that she can study the reflection for as long as the coin stays clear, which will be precisely as long as your breath remains even and your hand unshaking, and that any lie breathed into the air will haze the surface. She laughs at the audacity and accepts, stepping close enough to share breath but not close enough to disturb the coil’s wrap or the cloudfruit line’s lift. The press-gangers shout from below, but the mirror refuses to echo panic, and in that quiet you find the count to let Kesh play his trick with river light and shadow. When the coin fogs at last, you tuck it away like a secret folded twice, and Seresya is left with impressions that are useful but incomplete.\", \"outcome\": \"The Night Orchid leaves with a memory she trusts but cannot perfectly reproduce, which means she will need you again if the Matron’s curiosity grows teeth. She offers a lesser leverage token that still opens certain curtains and silences certain bells, and you mark its scent and weight like a locksmith learning a new key. The Chainwardens, should they hear a whisper, find nothing but the mention of a coin and a breath, which is the kind of evidence that dissolves under the Wind Court’s gusts. The Syndic’s men, harried by Kesh’s play of light and a decoy coil made from bundled oar handles, promise loudly to return with more papers and fewer scruples, but for tonight they fall back wet and none the wiser. Greydin’s coil slides into the hidden berth warm and righteous, and a lantern test later that week burns steady even when a downdraft moans, convincing three more skeptical foremen to sign the maintenance rota you needed.\"}\n  ],\n  \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"4\"], \"next\": [\"6\"]},\n  \"rewards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"2 phials of refined storm-oil (utility consumables)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Faction Favor\", \"description\": \"Lantern Yards favor (priority refuel in emergencies)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Social Currency\", \"description\": \"Night Orchid leverage token if Seresya was allowed a sketch (or grudging respect if denied)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Hidden berth access at Mirefurl Tower Three confirmed for future use\"}\n  ]\n}"
