"{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Three Grits to Clarity\",\n  \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Istel Shardwright\", \"affiliation\": \"Mirror Guild\"},\n  \"description\": \"Shattersea mornings are knives and mirrors, and the obsidian shelves sing in thin voices when the cold meets the sun. Quarry taps tick like a metronome for the heart, and the meltpool breathes a thread of mist that climbs the still air like a vow. Istel Shardwright meets you on a wind-scoured ledge with a crate of grits—coarse for hunger, medium for patience, fine for truth—and a superstition carved into muscle memory about polishing only when the wind comes from the east. The Mirror Guild says truth refracts but does not vanish, yet the Skyscribes mutter that prediction without permission is a storm loosed in a courtroom, and their adept Nalia Pree brings a bundle of wind-readings and a plea to slow your hands. Jealous apprentices eye the polishing bench, their debts and ambitions jangling louder than their tools, and the Mirror Queen’s reflection in the black water seems to watch for your first mistake. Between gust and glint, between the song the city trusts and the proof it fears, you and Istel will grind a lens able to read the pressure-ghosts in ink and the hesitation of a scribe who knew they were being watched. If the lens shows alignment marks invisible to any naked eye, it will point down and away—toward the Sunken Atelier where rope geometries dream and the tenth knot waits like a rumor sharpened to an edge. When the last grit falls silent, you must carry this brightness through a mirror-portal in the Sky Market, slipping among stalls that sell reflections and secrets with equal weight, and return to Ankharion without alerting rivals who would chain the truth or set it afire.\",\n  \"objectives\": [\"Escort Istel Shardwright along the quarry shelves of the Shattersea and collect a pouch of volcanic salts for lens tempering.\", \"Guard the polishing bench from jealous apprentices while Istel grinds the Cirrus Splitter Lens using three grits.\", \"Discuss findings with Nalia Pree, a Skyscribe adept, and compare wind vectors to mirror-read micro-scratches.\", \"Use the finished lens to examine the ledger scrap and map hidden alignment marks pointing toward the Sunken Atelier.\", \"Smuggle the lens back to Ankharion through a mirror-portal stall in the Sky Market without alerting Guild rivals.\"],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Istel Shardwright\", \"lines\": \"Hold the bench when the wind wakes, and listen to the glass like you would listen to a lover who knows a dangerous story. There, feel that tremor traveling through your palms and into your bones; that is the edge telling us truth wants out and it will cut us bloody if we rush. Three grits, Lyris, three vows, three breaths for every circle of the hand, because never polish in anger, never blink at the reflection that frightens you, and never mistake your own face for the only face in the mirror. The east wind carries steadiness through the Shattersea shelves and keeps the meltpool’s breath even, so we work now or we do not work at all for fear of warping the song in the lens. Jealous eyes will gather like gulls when they smell a sliver of mastery, and the Mirror Queen loves to watch a fool perform, so we lock our stance, we measure our strokes, and we let patience do the cutting while the world mistakes stillness for surrender.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Nalia Pree\", \"lines\": \"You trust glass to parse motives pressed into paper, and I respect the craft, but do not mistake reflection for consent from the winds that hold this city aloft. Our kites have tasted these currents for years, and there are patterns we do not publish because revelation is not the same as rescue when panic drives policy. Ten-knot vectors promise a door to certainty with no hinges and no brakes, and if you open it at the wrong moment the air will not close behind you, it will rush through the city and turn counsel into calamity. I came with readings taken at three towers and two whisperstone circles, and they hum with a warning cadence that has preceded every failed Tensioning rehearsal in our records. Work if you must, compare our vectors with your micro-scratches, and prove me wrong if you can, but do not hand a weapon to those who would wield it for spectacle or vengeance rather than safety.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Lyris Kael\", \"lines\": \"I grew up counting bolts while the Old Song kept time, and I learned that steel sings different when fear holds the wrench. I do not care whether the truth comes on wind or glass if it keeps Ankharion from snapping its own spine to please a ledger or a liturgy. If your kites and our mirrors find the same riverbed beneath the rumor, we will walk it together and argue about names after we put stones in the banks, and if they part ways then we sit with the dissonance until our breath steadies. Neither Chainwarden edicts nor Aerarium tallies gets this lens without an oath that binds them to preservation before advantage, and I will stand in the Wind Court to make that oath ring the Hinge if I must. Give me your vectors and I will give you our scratches, and together we will ask the question in a language the city can survive.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Istel Shardwright\", \"lines\": \"There, love, do you see it now that the fine grit sings true, a whisper of hesitation scored into the ledger’s skin where ink tried to hide a shiver. The scribe pressed harder here and here, not enough to blot but enough to carve a ghost line, and in those tremors I read doubt and a watcher’s breath collected at the nape. We overlay your wind marks against these scratches and the alignment resolves into a thin path pointing toward the marsh’s slouching halls where brass remembers and water hums equations. The Atelier calls with a patient voice, and I am afraid because the last time I heard a song like this it belonged to a lens that cracked a guild and a family with equal clarity. We will seal the Cirrus Splitter in oilcloth, we will walk with quiet hands past envy and into shadow, and we will decide together who deserves to look through it first and what price we ask for letting them borrow our sight.\"}\n  ],\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Set the mirror to law\", \"text\": \"Present the finished lens and your preliminary overlays to the Wind Court under the Mirror Guild’s auspices, insisting on public demonstration and recorded oaths. You request Chainwarden observers for safety, Skyscribe auditors for fairness, and a written clause that the lens may not be sequestered without cross-guild consent. You argue that only a transparent ritual of proof can prevent panic and preempt quiet theft, and that the city is calmer when truth stands in the sun with a bell beside it. This path risks offending Skyscribes who fear erosion of their counsel and enraging apprentices who hoped to steal glory in a side alley, but it binds powerful hands to witnessed promises. It also marks you as a bridge between rivals, which is a fine way to become a road for knives when the wind shifts.\", \"outcome\": \"The Court session fills with banners and cautious breaths, and the Hinge carries the verdict bell across three corners as required while the lens reveals alignment marks that match Nalia’s safer vector ranges. The Chainwardens, forced to speak in the open, concede that the findings merit a controlled reconnaissance of the Sunken Atelier with limits set by joint decree, and they sign an oath that makes the bell tremble at a whisper when read. The Mirror Guild’s star rises and your name passes behind curtains in the lens quarter, but Skyscribe traditionalists scowl in windward seats and write you into their storm calendars as a variable to watch. A Night Orchid runner brushes your shoulder on the way out to remind you that a road known to law is also known to thieves, and a second, quieter set of eyes begins following the lens. When you leave by the Sky Market’s mirror stall, you feel the air bend around you like a question that has not yet chosen whose lips it will use to speak.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Bind the wind in secret\", \"text\": \"Agree with Nalia Pree to keep the lens’s existence off the Court’s docket until a joint catalogue of risks can be drawn, prioritizing method over spectacle. You store the lens in a Skyscribe tower under a cross-oath that any reading requires two guilds present and a Stormsteppe whisperstone alert to a neutral third. Together you refine vector overlays at midnight, comparing gust harmonics to micro-scratch cadence while jealous apprentices scour the Shattersea for rumors and find only their reflections. You plan a small, stealthy approach to the Sunken Atelier guided by windroads instead of decree, and you let the Mirror Guild’s reputation gains accrue in whispers rather than in songs. This path angers certain Mirror masters who wanted a triumphal demonstration and tempts the Night Orchids to monetize the secret, but it buys you time to learn the lens’s moods before you ask it to look at something that could unbind a city.\", \"outcome\": \"Your partnership with Nalia develops into a measured braid of wind and glass, and quiet experiments reveal that the lens hums when aimed through skyglass at dawn, hinting at deeper resonance you can harness or fear. The Aerarium’s auditors, denied a public hook, start sniffing through the Sky Market and stir up a rival cell that wants to sell a counterfeit, forcing you to mislead thieves with a decoy polished just imperfectly enough to betray them. The Mirror Guild grumbles but shields you from open censure because results trickle in, and a few elders remember that sometimes patience is sharper than a parade. A Skyscribe dissident slips you a maplet of eddies that skirt Lantern Yards patrols, and the path toward the Sunken Atelier sharpens into a line only you and a handful can read. When you finally step through the mirror-portal with the lens wrapped against your ribs, you carry not just a tool but a pact, and the city’s Old Song seems to hold its breath rather than ring the alarm.\"}\n  ],\n  \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"2\"], \"next\": [\"4\"]},\n  \"rewards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Cirrus Splitter Lens (reveals micro-scratches and latent alignment marks)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Mirror Guild reputation increase (access to lens quarter backrooms)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Map\", \"description\": \"Map fragment indicating an entrance route to the Sunken Atelier\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Letter\", \"description\": \"A note from Nalia Pree promising cautious cooperation\"}\n  ]\n}"
