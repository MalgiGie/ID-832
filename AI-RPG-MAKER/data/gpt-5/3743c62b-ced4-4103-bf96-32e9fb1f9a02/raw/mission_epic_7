"{\n  \"id\": \"7\",\n  \"title\": \"The Shard That Sings\",\n  \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Nalia Pree\", \"affiliation\": \"Mirror Guild\"},\n  \"description\": \"The Shattersea’s eastern shelf has begun to sing in a register that turns breath to frost and makes lantern flames lean toward the water as if listening. Lenses ground from the vein’s plates show slivered futures and fogged regrets, and kites flown above the meltpool tug toward winds whose footsteps are still a valley away. At dawn, on a ledge slick with salt dew and flecked obsidian dust, Nalia Pree has arranged a covert parley where the cliff face reflects your face in a hundred ripples, each with a different weather behind your eyes. She asks you, Lyris Kael, to bring the Cirrus Splitter Lens and the tripod with the softwood pads, because the stone hum cracks hard feet and warps unblessed metal. Erynn Sythar arrives hooded like a contraband prayer, equations stitched into the hem of their cloak, and the air around them smells of rain on copper. The Mirror Queen is rumored to rise where reflections are most honest, and the shelf today feels like a courtroom of water where truth is not negotiated but weighed. You must align lens and kite to the angle markers Nalia has chalked, hold position as the hum peaks and the glass draws a ten-knot predictive curve like a silver thread through a black loom, and then decide how to split what you catch so no single faction sails the city by the throat. The quarry hoists creak as crews change shifts above, Skyscribes argue auguries with lenswrights at the rim, and somewhere in the obsidian a note sustains so pure it could slice a lie into ribbons.\",\n  \"objectives\": [\"Meet Nalia Pree and Erynn Sythar at the singing shelf of the Shattersea before sunrise.\", \"Set the Cirrus Splitter Lens on its tripod and align with Nalia’s kite angle markers.\", \"Hold position while the obsidian’s hum peaks and the lens reveals a ten-knot predictive curve.\", \"Record the curve on oiled vellum and split copies between Nalia and Erynn without triggering Mirror Guild censure.\", \"Depart through a quarry workers’ hoist as tensions spike between Skyscribes and lenswrights.\"],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Nalia Pree\", \"lines\": \"When the air sings like this, it is either prophecy or madness, and sometimes both in a single breath that tastes of glass. Do not let the Mirror Guild’s towers fool you into thinking we are strangers to the edge, because every polished lens is a wager against heat, fracture, and ambition. This shelf has cracked better tripods than the one you carry, which is why I cut softwood feet and inked angle markers in salt so the hum will not warp our truth. Set the Cirrus Splitter so its heart looks slightly off true; the singing corrects it, and the correction is where futures reveal their seams. If the Mirror Queen rises, do not ask her for mercy, only for clarity, because mercy is cloudy and clarity cuts clean. I will take the third and sixth positions if the curve unspools as Erynn predicts, and I will guard them with craft oaths and salt rites, because my guild’s pride must be bridled by procedure. Keep your breath even and your hands still, Lyris, and remember that honesty here is as heavy as a chain link and as sharp as its edge.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Erynn Sythar\", \"lines\": \"Prediction is a chain if you let it bind your ankles, and a sail if you tie it to the right wind with a knot you can release when danger shifts. We do not need the whole curve to save Ankharion from its worst futures; we need only enough positions to time a partial unmooring without giving the Aerarium a monopoly on tomorrow. Give me the first and the eighth points, because they bracket onset and decay, and because my colleagues can build safe timing from those without exposing the central resonance that tyrants would tax. Give Nalia the third and sixth, because those speak in the language of glass and craft, and because her oath-ink will keep them from being stolen by those who think reflection is ownership. Record the rest in a hand that looks like nobody’s, and fold it into oiled vellum cut with a broken-circle margin so any Chainwarden who finds it cannot swear it within the Court. If the hum swells into a crest, count six breaths on the whisperstone beat and lift the kite one hand-span to keep the phase from snapping, because a snapped phase is a rumor that never stops running. I will stand between the Skyscribes and the lenswrights when voices rise, and I will wear the blame if the Wind Court asks who taught the curve to sing in human ears.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Istel Shardwright\", \"lines\": \"I should be jealous of a stone that sings better than I do, but envy is a grit that ruins polish, and I like you clear. Listen to the harmonics along the rim and feel how one line threads your pulse; that is fear making room for awe, and awe is the only honest payment we owe a first sight. The Mirror Queen, if she steps through, will not demand flattery, only a face that does not blink when the water shows a cut you gave yourself by mistake. Take the Mirror Coin I polished for you and breathe on it when the hum peaks; if your resolve hazes the surface, step back and let me reset the tripod so your courage has a second chance to set. The Guild will want the curve whole and clean, but wholeness is a tyranny when it lives in one vault, so split it like you would a dangerous love and give each half enough to live without enough to command. I have bribed a hoist hand with a cracked lens blank; if quarrel turns to quarrels, we can ride the workers’ cage down while the Skyscribes argue statutes with Nalia’s cousins. Whatever you choose, promise me you will not let anyone call your steadiness a crime; in Ankharion they gild rashness and crucify patience, and I will not see you nailed for being careful.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Lyris Kael\", \"lines\": \"I will not be the city’s handmaiden or its knife, because both are used until they dull and then sold for scrap, and I have not come this far to hang on a peg. I will be its hand on a line, knuckles white, breath measured, eyes hard, listening for the Old Song beneath the new and tying only the knots I can untie without breaking the rope. Take your pieces, Nalia and Erynn, and keep them like ember and ash, useful only when joined by a third truth that I will carry until the Crown of Cirrus sets its ring over us all. If the Queen rises, I will not bow, but I will not lie either, and if she asks what I want I will tell her I want a sky that does not sell itself in chits and futures. When voices climb the basalt and the hoists rattle, I will use my cloak’s quiet and my chime’s whisper to guide us out, and I will leave only the taste of salt and a rumor that someone listened better than they shouted. I have debts to apprentices who still dream of tying a knot that frees instead of binds, and I will not sell those dreams into a vault where the key clangs every time a tariff spikes.\"}\n  ],\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Stitch the sail, share the load\", \"text\": \"You follow Erynn’s proposed apportionment with a precision that would make the Torsion Archives hum in agreement. You set the lens half a thumb askew so the singing center corrects it, count the six breaths on the whisperstone beat, and inscribe the first, third, sixth, and eighth positions in separate hands that look like three different scribes. You fold Erynn’s pair into oiled vellum sealed with a Skyscribe knot that reads as weather notes, and you tuck Nalia’s pair behind a false backing in a lens case rubbed with storm-oil to mask the scent of fresh ink. You speak aloud a small oath that promises delay before disclosure, tightening the timeline so neither party can weaponize the data without the other’s confirmation. When a Skyscribe journeyman demands to see your pages, you show him a decoy harmonic sketch that sings correctly but goes nowhere, and you keep your heartbeat steady until he hears what he expects. You move toward the workers’ hoist with Istel shadowing your steps, your glide harness folded and your chime tugging air the way you need it to go, while the shelf keeps singing as if the city has already decided to breathe differently.\", \"outcome\": \"Nalia accepts the third and sixth with the solemnity of a craft oath and thanks you with a cord charm whose bells ring courage rather than noise. Erynn hides the first and eighth beneath weather calendars and swears to bring only the timing, not the tension, to any debate about a partial unmooring before the Wind Court. The Mirror Guild grumbles but files no censure because your procedure was meticulous and the decoy sketch fed their pride just enough to quiet their suspicion. The Skyscribes mark you as competent but not reckless, and the hoist tender runs the cage without questions, letting you vanish into the fog-veined scaffolds while arguments simmer above. By the time you reach the Mirefurl road, you carry four points that cannot crown a tyrant alone and a promise from each faction that their next move will require the other, setting the city’s future on a pair of rails instead of a single ledge.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Let the mirror lead, mask the wind\", \"text\": \"You privilege the Mirror Guild’s handling without granting them command, presenting the third and sixth as polished gems while cloaking the first and eighth in a cloud of Skyscribe obfuscation. You stage a small spectacle at the rim, letting Nalia’s cousins witness a precise alignment so that their pride focuses on optics rather than ownership, and you whisper to Erynn that public deference buys private latitude. You draft the timing points in a cipher that reads like humidity measurements and stash them in a weatherproof tube strapped inside your cloak, while you engrave the craft-relevant points on a glass slip that looks like a gift rather than a weapon. You speak to a Skyscribe adept in their own liturgy of three confirmations, giving them two and promising the third after the Crown of Cirrus, turning their appetite for closure into a leash on patience. When tensions spike and a lenswright throws an insult that sounds like a theorem, you let the argument bloom and slip away along a catwalk that smells of tar and lightning, your glide harness catching a supervised updraft that delivers you to the hoist’s shadow.\", \"outcome\": \"The Mirror Guild files a favorable note about your cooperation and extends an informal neutrality for future Shattersea work, satisfied that their positions gleam with the polish of precedence. Erynn pockets the disguised onset and decay points with a thin smile and an even thinner promise to keep them among Skyscribes who value safety over leverage, leaving you a cipher phrase for future drops. The Skyscribe journeymen cool their tempers because their doctrine has been respected in form if not in fullness, and no whistle is blown to summon Chainwardens to the shelf. The hoist rattles and clanks, but its keeper waves you through, remembering the little charity you arranged for his apprentice with a cracked lens polish that taught them patience. When you step off on the lower gantry, you carry the same four positions distributed as planned, and you have tilted the political lens toward truce rather than trial for at least one expedition.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Hide the heart, braid the edges\", \"text\": \"You choose to hold the composite key in your own keeping, splitting the four positions as promised while braiding their contexts into a knot only you can unpick. You copy each point twice, once in a hand learned from the Torsion Archives and once in a sailor’s log hand, and you place a private, harmless error in each that only you and Istel can correct on short notice. You persuade Nalia and Erynn to accept their portions under a delay rite tied to the Crown of Cirrus, arguing that the city’s nerves cannot handle a perfect truth today without tearing muscle. You seed the shelf with three rumor-thorns—odd, harmless notations that lead any eavesdropper toward irrelevant harmonics—while you carry the true alignment in the seam of your whispercloak hem. As the hum peaks and then softens into a breath you could mistake for your own, you signal the hoist and time your departure between a shouted accusation and a laughing denial, letting the quarrel consume attention while you vanish into the shaft like a note swallowed by thick air.\", \"outcome\": \"Both factions hold the positions they sought, but neither can operationalize them without your final correction, and you become the hinge that keeps the door from slamming either direction. The Mirror Guild’s censure mechanisms never trigger because your copies look like sanctioned craft notebooks, and the Skyscribes find their points couched in ordinals that only make sense when the wind carries a rare triad, which you alone can read. Istel’s presence ensures your placement of harmless errors is reversible in a heartbeat, and the promise you make each faction—that you will stand in the Wind Court when the Crown of Cirrus banners rise—buys you time and binds them to a public path. The hoist delivers you to a lower catwalk smelling of tar and salt, and a Night Orchids scent-thread you laid yesterday leads any pursuers into a loop around the polishing halls until their tempers cool. You move on with four fragments safe, two factions placated, and your leverage intact enough to prevent anyone from using the song of the Shattersea to drown out the chorus of the city.\"}\n  ],\n  \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"6\"], \"next\": [\"8\"]},\n  \"rewards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"Key Item\", \"description\": \"Ten-knot curve fragment containing positions 1, 3, 6, and 8, apportioned across allies to prevent unilateral control.\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Charm\", \"description\": \"Calming cord charm from Nalia Pree that steadies breath and resolve, reducing panic during high-wind checks.\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Faction Pact\", \"description\": \"Mirror Guild neutrality pact for one expedition at the Shattersea, reducing interference and inspections during fieldwork.\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Cipher\", \"description\": \"Erynn Sythar’s encrypted notation scheme for future equation drops, enabling secure transmission of predictive data.\"}\n  ]\n}"
