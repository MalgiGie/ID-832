Her mother tied festival knots at the Knotfast Commons; her father mended tram harnesses until a tariff squeeze by the High Tithe Syndic sank the family into debt. As an eager apprentice, Lyris caught the eye of a Chainwarden inspector who bound her to a predatory maintenance contract—until Yassa Nim of the Night Orchids cut her cord in the dark, swapped the ledger page, and demanded a future favor. Trained in rooftop routes, scent-trails, and tuned chimes, Lyris became a courier between factions that never publicly meet. In the Sky Market’s lens quarter she befriended Istel Shardwright of the Mirror Guild, whose laugh at the Shattersea’s edge taught Lyris that truth refracts but does not vanish. On a lantern convoy skirting the Stormsteppe, she saved Kesh Storm-Runner—a thunderherd rider—from a press-gang raid sponsored by delta brokers; since then Kesh runs windroads for her when the city’s routes are watched. Lyris now runs black cords for the Unmoored, ferrying knot-calculus fragments copied from the Torsion Archives and moving cloudfruit-lift prototypes under Aerarium noses. She has stepped into the Chain Cathedral’s nave to swear oaths she intended to keep and then broke for the city's sake—hearing the Hinge ring on a windless night. With Crown of Cirrus omens rumored to return, she stands on the cusp of a plan that could loosen Ankharion’s chains without snapping them, if she can outpace the Chainwardens’ militias, the Aerarium’s accountants, and the Orchids’ ledgers.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Whispercloak\",\n      \"description\": \"A gray, hooded cloak dyed with storm-lichen that blurs edges in lamplight and muffles metal brush; inner bell toggles can be silenced for Wind Court skulking.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Hook Gloves\",\n      \"description\": \"Goatskin gloves with mirror-steel microhooks for chain climbing and catwalk arrests; padded palms resist heat from freshly greased links.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cloudfruit Line\",\n      \"description\": \"Twenty meters of braided cloudfruit cord that briefly lightens loads when knotted correctly; marked with tiny color codes for emergency lifts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tuned Chime Pendant\",\n      \"description\": \"A thumb-sized Night Orchid airflow chime, calibrated to nudge eddies for whisper-carry; illegal outside sanctioned rituals.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mirror Coin\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm coin of Shattersea skyglass polished by Istel; true faces shine clear, lies haze the surface for a heartbeat.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lantern Oil Phial\",\n      \"description\": \"A sealed ampoule of storm-oil from the Lantern Yards; burns steady in gusts or spikes a whisper-engine for a rapid escape.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Glide Harness\",\n      \"description\": \"Foldable shoulder-kite rig from the Sky Orchard with silverleaf vanes; slows falls between terraces and catches maintenance updrafts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lockroll\",\n      \"description\": \"Cord-wrapped kit of picks, tensioners, a rake, and a wax seal copier for customs stamps and oath-presses.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Forged Customs Chits\",\n      \"description\": \"Saffron-tabarded papers with a stolen Aerarium watermark, good enough to pass a glance at the Sky Market on a busy tier.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Whisperstone Shard\",\n      \"description\": \"Flat wind-carved stone from the Stormsteppe that carries her voice to a matched ring used by Kesh’s clan.\"\n    }\n    ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 11,\n    \"agility\": 16,\n    \"constitution\": 12,\n    \"intelligence\": 14,\n    \"wisdom\": 11,\n    \"charisma\": 13,\n    \"dexterity\": 17,\n    \"endurance\": 12,\n    \"perception\": 16,\n    \"luck\": 15\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Urban traversal across chainhouses and ribbon-bridges\",\n    \"Subterfuge and disguise tailored to guild fashions\",\n    \"Negotiation with guild clerks and steppe clans\",\n    \"Knot-lore and oath-reading\",\n    \"Wind-listening and eddy prediction\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Yassa Nim\": \"Night Orchids mentor who cut Lyris free of a predatory Chainwarden contract during Knotfast; teaches chimes and scent-trails, and keeps a debt ledger with Lyris’s name inked twice.\",\n    \"Istel Shardwright\": \"Mirror Guild lenswright and confidant; crafts illicit skyglass tools and reads omens with Lyris at the Shattersea—trust warmed into a quiet romance.\",\n    \"Kesh Storm-Runner\": \"Thunderherd courier from the Stormsteppe; life-debt turned partnership.
