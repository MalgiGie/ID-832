"{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"The Bell That Rang in Stillness\",\n  \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Yassa Nim\", \"affiliation\": \"Night Orchids\"},\n  \"description\": \"On a windless night the Hinge bell in the Chain Cathedral tolled by itself, and Ankharion held its breath as if a city of stone remembered it could float. The Old Song faltered on a sour note that seemed to thread Lyris’s bones, tugging at every broken promise she had ever hidden under her whispercloak. Beneath the Knotfast Commons’ black-cord pole, where names are tied without being spoken and bells are forbidden to ring, Yassa Nim waits with ink-stained fingers and grease-smudged sleeves, the look of someone who has crossed a dozen lines and left only rumors standing in her footprints. She speaks of an oath snapped in the Cathedral’s nave, the kind recorded by an oath ledger whose pages are oiled like prayer and numbered like debts, and of an Orchid runner who went in for a simple page-swap and never came back to report his success or his ghost. The Chain Cathedral’s ribs groan softly in the stillness, and every rivet looks like an eye that knows exactly how many oaths Lyris has bent to keep people breathing and promises alive. To learn what woke the Hinge, Lyris must slip through choir scaffolds timed to hymns, kneel under the third nave bench two rivets shy of a broken-circle stamp without letting her heel touch the iron taboo, pry out a hidden ledger slip, and carry it like a live spark to the Sky Market where skyglass can coax truth out of soot and sweat. Istel Shardwright will read the ghost-scratches in farseeing light, but Matron Vessa has a ledger of her own and will demand proof, a culprit, or a body before the Night Orchids decide to balance their books in blood. The city’s chains sway as if remembering stories of sailing free, the Wind Court listens for an edict on the breeze, and Lyris feels the hush stretch tight enough that one more broken oath might snap the whole chord.\",\n  \"objectives\": [\"Meet Yassa Nim under the black-cord pole at Knotfast Commons after sundown.\", \"Enter the Chain Cathedral via the choir scaffolds and avoid Chainwarden acolytes on grease-duty.\", \"Recover the hidden ledger scrap from beneath the third nave bench, two rivets shy of a broken-circle stamp.\", \"Use Istel Shardwright’s skyglass at the Sky Market to reveal micro-scratches and decode the ledger line.\", \"Deliver a clean copy of the ledger line to Yassa Nim for the Night Orchids and a second copy to Erynn Sythar at an Unmoored dead drop.\"],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Yassa Nim\", \"lines\": \"You hear it too, little shadow? The bell that forgot the wind, the Hinge that never speaks without a gust, sang out in a stillness thick as old grease. When a nave oath snaps without breath to carry the sound, it is not merely a private shame; it is the city leaning closer, counting, weighing, and deciding if we are worth the iron that holds us. I sent a boy with a clean heart and quiet feet to lift me a line from the oath ledger, a routine swap so tidy even the Hinge should have slept through it, and the boy vanished between one ratchet of the Old Song and the next. The page he was meant to fetch is folded under the third bench, two rivets shy of a broken-circle stamp, and if you step wrong you will wake superstitions older than the Anchorworks and meaner than Matron Vessa’s ink. Bring me that line and what it says in scratches the ink refused to hold, and I will strike your name from one corner of the Matron’s ledger where it sits like a thorn; fail me, and she will write deeper, and the bell that rang in stillness will teach you how loud silence can be.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Lyris Kael\", \"lines\": \"The last time the Hinge rang for me was the night I chose a life over a law, and the echo clung to my lungs so long I learned to breathe around it. I know the Cathedral’s cadences and where the hymn folds hide a footfall, and I can climb a choir scaffold so gently that grease on the rail will keep its secrets until after dawn. If there is a page tucked where rivets remember broken circles, I will put my fingers to the seam and lift it like a confession, and I will not let my heel kiss the taboo no matter how the old habit pulls me aside. Istel’s lens will catch what soot whispered to paper and what thumb-oil swore in haste, and I will carry two copies, one for the Orchids who trade in debts and one for those who would unmoor debts entirely. If the boy can be found in the ledger’s shadow, I will find him too, and if a trap waits, I will spring it like a snare and tie it closed again before the bell thinks to breathe.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Istel Shardwright\", \"lines\": \"Bring me whatever you pry loose from that sanctified machinery, and I will show you how light remembers what ink pretends to forget. Truth refracts but does not vanish, and the lens I ground under a gust-stable flame can read micro-scratches left by a quill starving for oil or a hand hungry for time. We will sit under the Sky Market’s ringing flags where customs stewards blink at the wind and not at us, and I will tilt the skyglass until soot becomes script and script becomes a confession the Chainwardens never meant you to see. The Mirror Guild will not claim this in public, but the Shattersea taught us that even the darkest glass has seams where secrets leak if warmed by patient hands. Come wary, because the Chainwardens have been watching the lens quarter since the bell, and even a friendly glint can look like treason when the air refuses to move.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Rul Fen\", \"lines\": \"You come near that nave on an off day and I’ll smell the Orchid perfume three tiers away, Kael, and I’ll know you brought it because you always bring trouble that thinks it’s a solution. The Chain Cathedral is not a bazaar where you barter oaths for coin; it is a hinge upon which the city’s shadow turns, and you do not tug at such a hinge unless you’re ready to carry what falls. You were almost a good apprentice once, almost a hand I could trust on a live chain, and then you learned to love shortcuts and secrets more than torque and prayer. If I see you under the Hinge, I will haul you out by the scruff of your cloak and make the bell sing your name, and I will let the Wind Court read the note as a verdict. Walk light if you’re fool enough to walk at all, because the acolytes on grease-duty have ears tuned to hymn and chime both, and the ledger you fancy is a ledger of lives, not a tally for thieves to balance.\"}\n  ],\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Sing with the Choir and Ghost the Scaffolds\", \"text\": \"You choose to time your approach to the Cathedral with the night practice of the hymn-choir, letting their rising thirds and falling fifths cover the whisper of your hooks on iron. You smear a thumb of consecrated grease across your glove to borrow its scent, then ease along the choir scaffolds where lantern colors shift like stained water. When the Hinge’s great ribs breathe, you breathe with them, counting under your breath in the Chainwarden cadence you swore you’d forget but never did. You move past an acolyte drowsing over a blessing brush, noting his ritual rhythm so you know where not to step when he wakes. The third bench waits like a remembered sin, two rivets shy of a broken-circle stamp, and you settle into a kneel that turns your heartbeat into a metronome and your hands into soft tools that do not betray you.\", \"outcome\": \"Your fingers find the hidden slip nested behind a shiver of varnish, and the paper’s edge is warm as if someone else’s fear still clings to it. A Chainwarden acolyte clears her throat and turns, but a voice crack in the choir makes her wince, and the sound gifts you one long breath to vanish upward into scaffolds and shadow. You taste metal and dust and the tang of old promises while you fold the slip into your whispercloak seam and confirm with your mirror coin that the seam’s haze is truth, not wish. Outside, the wind is still absent, yet somewhere above you hear a wind-harp answer a note you did not make, as if the city approves of the theft because it serves a different oath. By the time you step onto the ribbon-bridge toward the Sky Market, you have learned two things: the slip’s ink was laid down in haste, and the scratches beneath it were etched with a stylus built to hide its own angles, the kind the Unmoored favor when they expect to be read by enemies.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Bargain with a Chainwarden Acolyte\", \"text\": \"You pull your forged customs chits and your mirror coin, then pick the acolyte with the least sleep and the cleanest conscience, because such people are easiest to tilt without breaking. You speak in the old apprentice patter, quoting inspection codes and humidity tolerances that you learned the hard way in a chainhouse where injuries taught when edicts failed. You admit, with a careful tremor in your voice, that a ledger line was misfiled and that Arch-Warden Mael would rather find it quietly than wake the Hinge into rumors. You slide a tiny phial of lantern oil across, not as a bribe but as a gift for a night shift, and you let the acolyte see her own reflection steady in your mirror coin so she remembers the face that will answer for tonight. You offer a favor tied in a black thread, promising that when her turn comes to be cornered by a ledger, someone will come with a solution that does not cost her soul.\", \"outcome\": \"The acolyte swallows, glances up at the sleeping ribs of the Hinge, and decides that sanctity can share a bench with practicality when it keeps crises small. She takes your chit, stamps it with a sleepy oath-press that you carefully copy in wax for later, and whispers that the third bench’s concealment is old but still trusts in the taboo of the broken circle. Together you move through the nave like two notes in a lament, and she coughs once at a precise moment to cover the soft peel of varnish as you lift the slip. She does not ask what the scratches beneath the ink might confess, but she warns you that Rul Fen has been prowling the aisles looking for ghosts, and that he hates being right more than he hates being wrong. You depart with the slip and the knowledge that not all Chainwardens are iron before they are human, and that a favor tied tonight might bind you both to a future you cannot yet name.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Set the Wind Listening\", \"text\": \"You untie your tuned chime pendant and hold it between finger and thumb, feeling the old instruction Yassa taught you: not to push air, but to invite it to remember a habit it once loved. You give three gentle taps, the Night Orchid code for confusion, and let the chime bend small eddies into corridors that send candle smoke crawling in curious directions. Acolytes turn to scold imaginary drafts and mutter about door-seals, and a blessing brush falls with a clack that draws feet away from the benches you need. You thread the pause, zip a cloudfruit line around a rail to lighten your weight for a silent drop, and land in a crouch where a broken-circle stamp dares you to test your superstition. The bench’s underside yields to your hook pick, and you extract the slip while the Cathedral hums with a mischief it cannot name, as if the Old Song is amused to be an accomplice.\", \"outcome\": \"The chime’s work frays at the edges, and a Chainwarden novice tries to tune a wind-harp to counter the phantom draft, producing a sour note that makes the Hinge mutter in its sleep. You tuck the slip into your cloak hem and still the chime with a thumb, feeling the forbidden ten-step knot sewn there pulse with your heartbeat like a small, guilty star. A glance at the slip under stained glass shows ghost-scratches waiting like letters shy of a voice, and you know Istel will coax them to speech without breaking them. Outside, a gust finally noses the city and then thinks better of arriving, and the lack of wind seals your tracks as neatly as any Orchid perfume. You leave with the certainty that the Cathedral felt your touch but did not catch your name, and with a whisperstone note from Kesh in your pocket warning that the Wind Court’s verdict bell has been set out on the dais like a threat held in abeyance.\"}\n  ],\n  \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"2\"]},\n  \"rewards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"Favor\", \"description\": \"Night Orchid black-marker favor (minor debt reduction)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Currency\", \"description\": \"20 chain-chits for expenses from Yassa Nim\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Mirror Guild goodwill with Istel Shardwright (access to bespoke lenswork)\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Clue\", \"description\": \"Oath ledger references a 'Release calculus petition' scheduled in the Wind Court\"}\n  ]\n}"
