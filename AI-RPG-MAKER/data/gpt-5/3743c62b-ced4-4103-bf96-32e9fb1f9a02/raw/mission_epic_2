"{\n  \"id\": \"2\",\n  \"title\": \"Ghosts on the Winch Core\",\n  \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Erynn Sythar\", \"affiliation\": \"The Unmoored\"},\n  \"description\": \"The ledger scratch reads like the first step of a forbidden calculus, a ten-step knot smudged into nine, a mercy or a lie depending on who reads it. Erynn Sythar’s summons arrives in the old way—three taps on a chainhouse pipe, a folded page tucked into a gear’s teeth, a smear of lantern-oil in a pattern only the Unmoored study—and the oil smells faintly of thunderbeast musk, a signal that speed matters. They want the Cathedral’s heartbeat, not in hymns but in numbers, not in incense but in oscillation, a lattice of data that can translate devotion into thrust vectors and safety margins into sail plans. Above the winch core where choirs time the ratchets and acolytes anoint links, the air shivers with centuries of oaths, and there in the iron ribs a precise ear can hear the Old Song tremble on an off-note that priests call sanctity and engineers call error bars. Lyris must thread those ribs and plant copper-mesh whiskers tuned to drink minute tremors, then nestle a forbidden airflow chime behind a prayer scroll rack so the Unmoored’s receivers can turn breath into calculus and hymn into harmonic. Chainwardens drift through the nave like zealous metronomes in oil-stained vestments, and Rul Fen’s eyes are always looking up where others forget to, his suspicion as steady as the Hinge’s toll in a windless night. Steel and ritual grind together, and beneath it all is the hush of a city that might learn to move again without snapping, a possibility that tastes of cloudfruit sweetness and sanction’s ash.\",\n  \"objectives\": [\"Collect a bundle of copper-mesh tuning whiskers and a sealed airflow chime from Erynn’s dead drop at the Torsion Archives service hallway.\", \"Enter the Chain Cathedral through a maintenance vent near the stained-glass windbreaks, timing your movement to choir cadences.\", \"Affix tuning whiskers along the winch core’s upper flange and plant the airflow chime behind a prayer scroll rack.\", \"Copy the pressure-vector inscriptions chalked by senior Chainwardens and photograph them using Istel’s skyglass coin.\", \"Exit across the chainhouse catwalk and use the glide harness to reach the neighboring lantern tower without being seen.\"],\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Erynn Sythar\", \"lines\": \"You’ve danced along the Cathedral’s ribs before, but you never listened the way I need you to now, Lyris. The chain has a pulse the hymn hides, a faint tremor that slips between the choir’s cadences, and the whiskers I’ve built will taste that tremor like a tongue tastes salt on the wind. The chime is a heresy and a promise together; it will tease eddies into speech and let our receivers pull meaning from the breath behind the prayers. Bring me numbers, not heroics, because numbers will argue for us in chambers where no one will let us sing, and numbers will tell us which knot to loosen and which to leave bound. If you are seen, you are a thief; if you are heard, you are a blasphemy; if you are felt, you are a gust the Wardens will wall off with law. Go in as a subtraction that leaves no remainder, and when the Crown of Cirrus comes back around, we will have a stanza of the Old Song written in figures even the Hinge must respect.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Lyris Kael\", \"lines\": \"Numbers I can carry, and I can wear silence like a cloak; heroics go clang and stain the floor where oaths keep score. I know the choir’s breath and the timing of the ratchets, and I know where the stained glass throws blind light across the trusses so a shadow becomes a sermon no one remembers hearing. I will plant your whiskers where the tremor lives and leave the chime to whisper behind scripture, and I will copy the chalk marks the senior Wardens adore as if they were commandments carved in iron. If the chain speaks in the tongue you believe it has, we will hear it on the far side of the city through your coils and my coin, and the Old Song will show us where the ninth step wobbles toward a tenth. If Rul Fen looks up, I will already be crossing the catwalk, and if the Hinge rings at my back, it will be only because the wind loves a joke and not because I stepped wrong on a broken-circle rivet.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Rul Fen\", \"lines\": \"I smell copper and insolence long before I see either, and the Cathedral always gathers both in its rafters like dust that thinks it is thunder. There’s always someone who believes these ribs are scaffolding and shadow, that a clever hand can pry truth out of consecrated bolts without prying at the city’s bones. Hear me, Kael: the chains hold more than stone; they hold oaths stacked like weights on a scale that we dare not unbalance for the thrill of a calculation. Break the wrong one and the Hinge rings for funerals no bell-ringer meant to toll, and you don’t get a second wind or a quiet courtyard to think your regret into a lesson. I would rather scrape grease than scrape you off a ratchet, but if I must choose between you and integrity, I will keep integrity and mourn the smear, and I will do it without flinching so the city does not fall because I blinked.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Yassa Nim\", \"lines\": \"If Rul has to scrape you, little knot, it will be because you forgot to be small, and I didn’t carve you out of a ledger to see you poured back into one as a stain. Be small and be wind and be the hesitation behind an eyelid that never quite becomes a thought, and the Wardens will bless the space you occupy without knowing it was ever yours. Your chime is tuned to gossip and grief; let it fret the air just enough to loosen a tongue of numbers, not so much that a priest calls for incense and a cross-check. Take the dead drop with clean fingers and leave no scent but liturgical grease, and if you see our lost boy under the nave, bring me his ribbon or bring me the name of the hand that cut it so I can tie a bow on that story. Matron Vessa wants profit and the Sailor wants wind, but I want you home with your skin unscraped and your coins uncracked, and that means you remember the difference between daring and noise.\"}\n  ],\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Move with the Hymn\", \"text\": \"You choose to enter during peak choir surge, when the nave becomes a breathing organism and the ratchets sing in counterpoint to human throats. You time your crawl along the maintenance vent to the intake before each crescendo, counting the beats as if they were steps across a ribbon-bridge in a gale. The stained-glass windbreaks cast fractured color that hides your silhouette, and every pause becomes a prayer no one spoke. You test the chime’s mute with your thumb and feel it tremble, promising it will only whisper when you ask it to, not when the wind asks. It is a route that flatters your arrogance and your discipline equally, and it carries the sweetness of risk that tastes like cloudfruit and fines like confession.\", \"outcome\": \"The hymn masks your movements so thoroughly that lesser acolytes chalk you up to a trick of refraction and devotion, but the acoustics also turn your heartbeat into a companion you must ignore. You place the whiskers without a scrape, and the chime settles behind the prayer scrolls as if it were a nested reliquary, then hums once, low enough to feel only in teeth. Rul Fen pauses below, eyes crawling the ribs as if reading an oath out loud, and for a breath he listens to something that could be you and could be a flaw in his faith. You capture the pressure-vector inscriptions with Istel’s coin in three angles before a censor-pull drafts your scent toward the north transept, daring a cough you do not grant. The exit is a clean slip across the catwalk, but the glide to the lantern tower rides a gust that tries to fold you like a page, and you land with knees that remember to be grateful.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Between Oil Shifts\", \"text\": \"You bide your time until the maintenance changeover, when the vestments are dirtiest and pride sleeps behind stinging eyes. You move through the service hallway with a chainhand’s stoop and a fake saffron chit palmed for anyone who bothers with papers, letting grease smell carry your name instead of your voice. The Cathedral floor quiets like a beast between heartbeats, and you hear individual pins settling, each a syllable of the Old Song that the choirs will soon drown again. Acolytes trade oaths and oil rags at the pit, and their laughter makes a blind spot wide enough to park a sin in, which you exploit without romance. You plant each whisker with the care of a surgeon and the patience of a gambler who counts cards by touch, and you slide the chime into doctrine’s shadow like a rumor placed at the right table.\", \"outcome\": \"The hush cuts both ways: every brush of your cloak is a shout if you let it be, and you school your muscles to be archivist stillness until stillness becomes a muscle of its own. The whiskers pull clean signal almost immediately, the core quivering in arithmetic that tastes like a kept promise, and you feel Erynn’s future smile as if it were heat on your knuckles. Rul Fen doesn’t look up this time, but a junior Warden does, and he tracks an absence with a frown like a man who noticed a missing bell and can’t say which. You take extra time to frame the chalkwork with the coin, catching a faint smudge that suggests a correction someone was nervous to make, a detail that will matter later more than any flourish. Your exit across the catwalk is unremarked, but a lantern-warden on the neighboring tower notes a draft-snag in your glide and mutters a prayer to wind-spirits; later, that same warden will swear the wind answered with your name.\"},\n    {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Lantern Shadows and High Rafter Crawl\", \"text\": \"You wait for the Lantern Yards’ rehearsal lamps to swell the Cathedral’s stained glass with moving fire, turning every beam into a river that washes eyes where you want them. You go high, higher than comfort and nearly to penance, crawling the rafter lattice where dust motes practice processionals, and each handhold is a word in a language carved by fear and learned by practice. Your Whispercloak blurs into the light-play, and you use the tuned pendant to nudge a barely-there draft that makes banners twitch, gifting you handspan cover at a time. The choir’s warmup blurs into the Old Song, and for a terrible moment you feel the Hinge poised to ring from inside your chest, a warning you grind down to breath and task. You place the whiskers by touch alone while hanging like a verse to be recited, and you tuck the chime behind the scroll rack with a kindness that is also a violation, because you promise to return for it and know you won’t.\", \"outcome\": \"Light and shadow conspire in your favor, but they also turn Rul Fen into a hunter whose eyes learn new tricks mid-service, and you feel his attention graze you like cold iron. The whiskers hum back a pattern that resolves into clean beat variance, a signature Erynn will recognize as both opportunity and danger, and you savor the tiny victory like a thief tasting communion. Your coin catches the chalked pressure vectors in flare and dim, and one photograph ghosts a handprint beneath the latest line, as if the Warden who wrote it left a palm-sized doubt the glass could see. The exit is a dance with wind shear along the chainhouse catwalk, and the glide harness takes you out into a wash of lantern glow that makes your silhouette a sermon no one heard because the bells started on cue. You land on the neighboring tower with the chime’s echo teasing your teeth, and you know in a way that is not superstition that someone important hesitated instead of calling alarm, and that hesitation now lives in your pocket like a borrowed luck.\"}\n  ],\n  \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"1\"], \"next\": [\"3\"]},\n  \"rewards\": [\n    {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Unmoored trust increase (access to restricted dead drops).\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Countertension charm sewn into cloak hem (+1 chance to resist chain sway mishaps).\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Intel\", \"description\": \"Pressure-vector sketch of the winch core (used in later calculations).\"},\n    {\"type\": \"Narrative\", \"description\": \"A faint sense that Rul Fen is watching for more than a collaring; he hesitated.\"}\n  ]\n}"
