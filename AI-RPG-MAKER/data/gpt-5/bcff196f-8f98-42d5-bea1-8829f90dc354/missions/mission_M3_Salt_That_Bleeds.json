    "description": "The Salt Crown Exchange hums with chalk and breath as traders draw contracts in the sand-pit while wind-bells sing a ledger’s worth of warning. Counterfeit bricks have slipped past inspection, and a lost stamp threatens to unspool confidence. Matron Selde calls Kezra to audit the vault tiers and the inspection ledgers, promising neutrality and offering coin flavoured with salt necessity. Floor Marshal Hesk sweats in the cool vault and swears by old brine that his people never miss a flaw. The bricks themselves taste right, but each leaves a chalky ring like dried tears. Leaning into the memory of the rain-chain song, Kezra traces a pattern in the wind-bells that matches a cipher used by the Night Cartographers. Somewhere, someone has shaved truth thin and pressed it into a stamp.",

Find me the flaw before my rivals buy the whole city half-price. I won’t ask you to take my side, only to bind the truth to a weight, and let it drop where it must."

I have kept the winds off these vaults for a dozen years with bell and watch, and I’ll not be made a fool by shadows with rulers."
