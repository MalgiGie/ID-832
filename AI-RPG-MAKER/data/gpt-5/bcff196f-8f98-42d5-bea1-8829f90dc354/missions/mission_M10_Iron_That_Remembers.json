    "description": "The Ember Gate’s counterweight furnace lags, as if some unseen mass presses against the gate. Ore caravans from the Skygrind Steps arrive with carts sabotaged and dwarven patience wearing thin. Forgemistress Yael Emberkeel and Dhorik Basaltbane of the Steps ask Kezra to help prove a new alloy—an iron-thistle chain designed to ‘remember’ tension and hold it, to be hung in the Keep’s sluice-veins like a necklace that sings the right note back to the rain-chains. To forge it, the Collegium needs a steady run, protection on the Ember Road, and a pattern—perhaps from the shard—that tells iron which oath to keep. The reed-thing’s hunger beats at the gate like a tide in a well.",

        "Escort a test caravan to the Skygrind Steps; investigate sabotage sites and deter raiders.",

        "Install a test length in a sluice tunnel under Needle Keep with Castellan Mirra Hal’s leave.",
        "Report results to Yael and Dhorik, adjusting the alloy or pattern as needed."
