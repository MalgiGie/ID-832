    "description": "Archivist Irevan’s hands shake as he lays out maps that have faded not with age but with drought. The inks used by the first surveyors respond to verse-keys cut into the statues along the Sunken Road. The river has swallowed half the causeway and spat up stone leeches, but the debate under the mud can still be heard at new moon if you put your ear to the right slab. Kezra must travel with Gate-Captain Tholl’s cautious escort, make rubbings of inscriptions that appear only when the water drops, and pry a shard of oath-stone from beneath a toppled sage whose hands cup a bird’s nest. The Night Cartographers haunt the periphery, polite as midwives and twice as ready with a cloth to cover inconvenient cries.",

        "Secure Tholl’s escort and march to the Sunken Road with supplies for a tide cycle.",
        "At low water, make ink rubbings of three debate stanzas and take a tracing of the oath-keys hidden in moss.",
        "Retrieve the oath-stone shard lodged under a toppled statue without disturbing the nesting birds.",
        "Return the verse-keys to the Lantern Archive and reactivate a set of fading charts."
