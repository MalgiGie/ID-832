    "description": "The river runs low and the mists burn off too soon. In the Needle Keep, copper roofs drip in a windless hush while the rain-chains sing a thin, metallic descant that tugs at memory like a splinter under skin. Protector Arelon Vale summons Kezra Thorneglass to stand as neutral lantern-bearer between the Keep, the Hall of Shares, and the Order of the Black Thistle. Bellwright Dox insists the chains only sing before great changes—flood or famine, oath or war. The Oathstone in the central hall bears old cuts and a missing corner, and the grooves seem to sweat, salt fine as dust, when the chains strike a certain note. The Protector wants the song read as a map, the Order wants it read as a warning, and the guilds want it ignored until the Exchange bell closes. Kezra must listen to the chains, trace the resonance through the Keep’s hidden sluice-veins, and bring the first thread of truth to light before rumors harden into tariffs and threats.",

The rain-chains sing, and I’ve slept with that sound since boyhood, but this is not the cadence of weather. It’s a ledger, or a litany. Read it. Not to please me or the Hall—read it true, and tell me what oath it calls for, lest my guard march and my purse be empty at the same hour."

Each drop is a finger on a harp-string, and the whole Keep hums when the river is listening. Put your lantern-light to it, scribe-pilot, and mind your breath; the notes like to crawl up your lungs and ring your teeth."

I will not pretend that light knows more than water, but light remembers what water tries to carry off. Be wary, Kezra. Reading a sign is less dangerous than naming it aloud to men whose coin and pride are at stake."

If the note you hear is a call to penance, we must answer. If it is a call to war, we must refuse. I ask no obedience from you, oath-bearer, only conscience."
