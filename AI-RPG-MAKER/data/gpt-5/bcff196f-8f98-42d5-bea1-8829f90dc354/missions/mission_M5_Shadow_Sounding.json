    "description": "Night on the Low Veyne and the water lies black as a pupil. Master Pilot Olan Vetch knots a lantern to the prow and says the demon’s spine has shifted again where the sandbar runs like a broken oath. There is a body pinned under a snag, and the Brotherhood will not leave a pilot there to teach the reeds the taste of fear. Kezra must heave the sounding lead and read the silt on its tallow, mark the bar as it moves like a sleepwalker, and lift what the river holds without letting the ghost lights carry the crew off course. In the pilot’s vest is a shard of black stone that hums when held near the tongue—the missing corner of the Oathstone, or kin to it. The rain-chain cadence chimes in the knuckles, and the reed-thing’s wake is colder than the night.",

        "Join a Brotherhood crew to night-sound the moving sandbar and record its shift in lantern code.",

        "Bring the humming black shard to Sister Meret for reading and determine its relation to the Oathstone.",

And I don’t like what it says about the city’s tongue. We’ll not leave our dead under it. We earn our ghosts the right way."
