    "description": "Stormless noon. The Needle Keep glimmers as if it remembers rain. The iron-thistle chain is winched into the sluice-veins, the relic-needle rests beside the Oathstone like a thorn beside a wound, and the reflection-cutting lens hangs in its frame above a basin of still water—Glasslake calm stolen for a civic purpose. The tri-fold compact lies open in the Lantern Archive’s traveling case, its ink not quite dry. Below, the river braids and unbraids like hands worrying a prayer. The reed-thing comes at last into full sight: not a monster from elsewhere, but a man-shape woven of broken oath-threads, its mouth a slit of moving reeds, its eyes wet with borrowed promises. Kezra must read the rain-chains’ song aloud as a map, set the iron to humming in the right key, stitch the Oathstone’s missing corner with the relic-needle, and use the lens to cut the demon’s reflected path in water—severing it from the city’s shadow. The drowned queen’s memory waits at the edge of hearing, hungry and merciful both. What is bound here will haunt or shelter Thornspire for generations.",

        "Suture the Oathstone with the relic-needle while the Order intones the founding vows; feed the drowned queen’s memory the promised name at the precise verse.",
        "Use the reflection-cutting lens over a basin to draw out the demon’s mirrored path and cut it, anchoring the cut by pouring dark salt and signing the public oath-chart.",
        "Survive the reed-thing’s attempt to devour the city’s new vow; hold the compact steady and bind the final words to light in the Lantern Archive’s traveling lamp."
