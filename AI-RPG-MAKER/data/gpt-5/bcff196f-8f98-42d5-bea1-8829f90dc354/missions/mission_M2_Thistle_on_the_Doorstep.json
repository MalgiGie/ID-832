    "description": "By lantern-smear dawn, Finn Bracken rows under the Weir Market and raps Kezra’s skiff with a knuckle: another body, floating where the contraband sluice cuts under Stall 47. Thistle bundles have been left on doorsteps across the Floodwalk, and the reed-thing whispered about in taverns begins to collect a shape in rumor—long as a man, with a slit mouth that drinks vows out of the air. The Order of the Black Thistle demands a witness at the scene who can bind words from wriggling. Kezra must read the thistle knots, survey the eddies, and persuade the living to speak plainly while the dead say nothing but what their water-logged clothes have learned. The rain-chains’ tune is back in the ears like a headache, and the Oathstone’s salt-sweat seems thicker when the body is brought to shore.",

        "Examine the crime scenes at the Floodwalk, the contraband sluice, and a lamplit alley near the Loom Quarter.",
        "Use the oath-glyph kit to test the thistle bundles for vow-resonance and record any souring when lies are spoken nearby.",
        "Confer with Sister Meret, oath-reader, about the reed-thing stories; establish what is rumor and what is ritual.",
        "Deliver your findings at a small hearing in Black Thistle House, keeping the Hall of Shares from co-opting the conclusion."

I don’t like bodies where the sluices run; too many ways for truth to slide under a board. And those thistle bundles—somebody wants to say ‘I remember,’ and I think they mean ‘I accuse.’ Come see. Don’t bring bells."
