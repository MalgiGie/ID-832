    "description": "A new waterway has appeared in the Mourning Mire—a straight cut like a spear-thrust—and those who take it return without their shadows. The Willowwives whisper that a relic-needle of the drowned queen was stolen from the Order long ago, and the queen’s memory wants it fed with a true name before she bargains safe passage again. Ossa asks Kezra to bring fairness to the Accord and boldness to the rite: return with the relic-needle from a peat-cache, speak a name that means something, and balance the Accord with terms that do not tax the mire into clever lies. The reeds remember the night Kezra asked for a way out and paid something not yet collected.",
