    "description": "The Glasslake of Sere lies like a pupil that never dilates. The ruined observatory clings to its promontory, brasswork melted long ago by a heat that had a moral. The Night Cartographers, through Lysa Quill’s careful smile, offer Kezra a trade: recover a lens said to cut reflections from water like cloth, and they will deliver a map that dodges the reed-thing’s hunting grounds. Sula warns that such cuts leave scars in the mirror and the mind. The lake shows futures if stared at too long; the reeds on the shore gossip in breeze-voices about who drowned where. Kezra must decide who deserves the lens’s custody, and whether any price is fair when futures are currency.",

        "Decide whether to deliver the lens to the Night Cartographers, the Lantern Archive, or to keep it under Order seal.",
        "Resist a tempting ‘future’ shown by the lake; leave with mind and purpose intact."

Give it to us, and we’ll give you a path out of your city’s future that tastes like a lie you won’t have to tell."
