    "description": "The Hall of Shares becomes a theater. Matron Selde, Sera Verrin, Guildmother Brynna, Olan Vetch, and Prior Ansel gather under a crown of wind-bells that ring like a ledger of accusations. The counterfeit scandal is cooling, the moths sing again, and the Order’s vigil lantern burns—but the reed-thing feeds faster, and the river drops. Sera advances a charter to make House Verrin the city’s outfitter for all upriver expeditions—promising discipline and efficiency. Arelon asks Kezra to arbitrate a compact instead: Pilots, Spindlewrights, and the Order bound together by a public oath-chart in the Lantern Archive. The Night Cartographers tug at an old thread—a route Kezra sold in a desperate year—dangling shame as a price for silence. The room tastes of salt and sugar: Verrin customs laid bare.",
    "objectives": [
        "Convene the stakeholders and present the case for a public oath-chart held at the Lantern Archive.",
        "Expose the counterfeit line’s method without humiliating the Exchange; propose safeguards that strengthen trust.",
        "Confront the Night Cartographers’ leverage publicly before it festers; admit fault and close the thread.",
        "Draft and secure signatures on the tri-fold compact between Pilots, Spindlewrights, and the Order; deny or amend Sera’s charter without making an enemy beyond repair."

We draft the oath-chart here, we hang it in the Lantern Archive where anyone can read it, and we bind it to a bell that rings when someone tries to trim it. Sera, bring your efficiency; just don’t ask it to sit on the scales with its thumb out."
