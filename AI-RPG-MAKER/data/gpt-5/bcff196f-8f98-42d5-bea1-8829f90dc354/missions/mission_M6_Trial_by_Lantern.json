    "description": "A vigil lantern in Black Thistle House will not stay lit. The Order calls a secret hearing to test a ledger-knife taken from the Exchange’s shadow corridors, a woman who claims she falsified no stamps and cut no man’s reputation without cause. Sera Verrin attends as a ‘concerned citizen,’ and Floor Marshal Hesk sits pale and still with his hands folded like empty nets. Kezra is asked to light the vigil with memory oil and to cut a single reflection from the room—one look on one face—to hold up against a testimony. The shard recovered in the night lays on the altar and hums like a hive. When vows are spoken, it sings in the teeth.",
    "objectives": [
        "Attend the secret hearing as neutral witness; keep detailed lantern notes.",
        "Use the Glasslake reflection-shard to isolate one chosen reflection when testimony conflicts; present it carefully.",
        "Determine whether the ledger-knife’s confession is coerced, coached, or true; advise the Order’s judgment.",
        "Keep the hearing from collapsing into factional accusation between the Order and the Hall of Shares."

I convene them because lies nest in daylight and truth sometimes prefers a dark room and a single witness. Light the lantern, Kezra. Hold us all to its memory, myself most of all."

What I did do was whisper to a man that his courage was cheaper than salt, and he sold it to me. That is not a crime before the Exchange; it is a profession before the mirror."

If there was a forgery, expose it; if there was only ambition, do not crucify it because you dislike the face it wears. I would see the City governed by vows that do not turn to cudgels in pious hands."
