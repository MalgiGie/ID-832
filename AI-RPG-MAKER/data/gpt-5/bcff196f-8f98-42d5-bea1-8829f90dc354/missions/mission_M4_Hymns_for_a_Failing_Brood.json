    "description": "In the Loom Cathedral, looms creak like resting animals and silk panels shift color with the light. A moth blight has flicked its ash-black tongue across the brood, and apprentices weep in the dye gardens at night. Guildmother Brynna Coil admits, with a rare wince, that the Cathedral holds strains smuggled from a distant monastery, and they will not survive without harmonics only the Willowwives and a patient lantern can blend. Kezra must tune the nave’s pedal hymn to the moor-moths’ flight, negotiate openly with Ossa Wreath for a fair exchange, and decide whether to reveal the seed-vault’s secret to the Order’s eyes. The reed-thing rumors roost in the rafters; moths will not fly near vows that taste of ash.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Brynna Coil to learn the extent of the blight and the limits of the Cathedral’s secret strains.",
        "Travel to the Mourning Mire’s willow hovels to parley with Ossa Wreath; obtain moth-sense herbs and a fair contract.",
        "Tune the loom pedals to a harmonic sequence that soothes the brood and record it in lantern patterns for future seasons.",
        "Decide whether to inform the Order of the seed-vault’s existence and justify the choice to Brynna."

I have kept a secret to save the city’s veils, and secrecy is an acid even when it eats in the right direction. Help me sing to them, Kezra. And tell me if my silence is a sin I must confess."

Bring your lantern, let it listen to our reeds. Then you can ask me for a bundle of herbs and a word to your guildmother that is not a threat dressed for dinner."

If you get it wrong, the brood will not die—they will simply choose someone else to hear, and it will not be us."
