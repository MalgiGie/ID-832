    "description": "Black Thistle House breathed like a bellows in the night, its buttresses drinking the damp from the river mists and exhaling cold into the chapel where vows are meant to warm. Between reliquary shelves and spear-scored pillars, a vigil lantern sulked on its hook, guttering as if a mouth kept trying to blow it out from the other side of the flame. Sera Verrin arrived with the perfume of Exchange sand and ledger ink clinging to her, her smile the sort that asks a favor while pretending to offer one; Floor Marshal Hesk entered like a tired gate, hinges oiled but sagging on their pins. The ledger-knife came under escort through the side door, a woman with sleepless eyes and a blade-thin voice, known in the Exchange corridors as Cal Tesser, and known to herself as someone who had measured the price of pride in other people’s throats. Prior Ansel’s shadow fell like a thistle-spine over the Oathstone’s chipped corner as he summoned Kezra to the altar, bid the memory oil be poured, and asked the Glasslake shard to do what witnesses often fail to do: remember exactly one look without flattering itself. The shard, recovered from an anonymous palm in the night, lay on the altar cloth and thrummed as if a hive of bees had made a home inside cooled glass, and when the first oaths were spoken, the humming rose in everyone’s teeth like cold metal touched to a filling. Behind the chapel doors, Thornspire’s arguments waited: drought, counterfeit salt, pilot charts priced like bread, and the silent rumor that if the lantern could not be made to hold a memory, then truth itself had started to unmoor like barges in a bad surge. Tonight’s business was narrow as a blade and weighty as a millstone: light the lantern so that it would hold, cut a single reflection when words crossed like oars, measure the ledger-knife’s confession against that cut light, and prevent the hearing from turning into a brawl with polite words and ruined alliances.",
    "objectives": [
        "Attend the secret hearing as neutral witness; keep detailed lantern notes.",
        "Use the Glasslake reflection-shard to isolate one chosen reflection when testimony conflicts; present it carefully.",
        "Determine whether the ledger-knife’s confession is coerced, coached, or true; advise the Order’s judgment.",
        "Keep the hearing from collapsing into factional accusation between the Order and the Hall of Shares."

            "lines": "I do not convene these chambers to frighten merchants or to dress justice in ritual for the sake of spectacle. I convene them because lies nest in daylight and truth sometimes prefers a dark room and a single witness. Light the lantern, Kezra, and let its memory oil take the shape of our breath so it may later remind us whether we spoke as oath-keepers or coin-counters. Hold us all to its memory, myself most of all, for the Order’s first vow is to be weighed before it weighs others. If the lantern falters, if the flame winks like a guilty eye, I would sooner end this hearing than force it to burn on a lie. Let the Glasslake shard drink one look, only one, and let that look be a measure against which we shall set every word. And when we leave this room, let there be a single story we can tell the city without seasoning it with fear or favor."

            "speaker": "The Ledger-Knife (Cal Tesser)",
            "lines": "I cut ledgers to straighten them, not to bleed them, and when I say cut I mean the sort of cut that removes a tumor without killing the patient. The stamp that passed those bricks never touched my hand, nor did my whispers make it so; the Exchange holds more shadows than I can count and each shadow wants to own my name tonight. What I did do was whisper to a man that his courage was cheaper than salt, and he sold it to me because courage rarely survives accounting, and that is not a crime before the Exchange; it is a profession before the mirror. I have lied to liars to make them tell truths to paper, and I have paid for those lies with sleep, and I do not ask mercy for that. But this confession that you wave like a bloody cloth was taken from me beside an unlit lamp and a door that would not open, and a woman who would not give her name told me to sign if I loved my fingers. If your shard will keep one look, let it keep my face when I said no the first time, for that was the truest thing I did this season. If your vows demand blood anyway, at least call the cut honest and not pretty."

        {
            "speaker": "Sera Verrin",
            "lines": "We are all tempted to call our rivals’ strengths crimes of character and our own compromises necessities, and if I have ever yielded to that temptation I did so with my eyes open and my ledgers balanced. If there was a forgery, expose it and let us cut the rot cleanly; if there was only ambition, do not crucify it because you dislike the face it wears or the family it eats with. Thornspire is a garden of brambles where the innocent bleed and the guilty prune, and that is why our vows must not be cudgels disguised as garlands. I would see the city governed by vows that bind coin as tightly as chains but do not turn into chains for necks you already wished to bend. Kezra Thorneglass, you have made enemies by remembering too precisely for comfort, and that is precisely why I asked to witness this hearing, because a public trust will need more than piety to survive a hungry season. Measure me as well if you must, for it is better to be weighed now than bought later by rumor. And if tonight ends in clarity instead of theater, I will lend my voice in committee to the oath-chart you dream of, provided it preserves trade from zeal and zeal from trade."

            "speaker": "Floor Marshal Hesk",
            "lines": "I signed no false warrants and I did not sell my keys, but I did close an eye on a corridor where I should have opened two, and that failing sits heavy in the salt of my bones. Laziness can be as poisonous as theft, and the Exchange has a way of teaching a man that fatigue is a reasonable god to pray to while the vaults hum with other gods entirely. I kept the bricks honest for years, and I learned to hear a counterfeit by the way a cartwheel breathes on the sand, but I did not hear this one because I was listening to my own pulse and thinking of sleep. If you must weigh a man, weigh that against the seasons I kept the vaults clean, and do not forget that stones crack not only because they are struck but also because winter lingers. If the shard looks at me and finds a blink too long, I will own it and stand the censure, but I will not be made the mask for another’s knife. Tell me plainly what the lantern remembers so I may make my peace with what I failed to do. And if you judge me, judge me in full light and not by the rumor that crawls under doors."

            "lines": "I will cut one reflection and only one, and not because I enjoy the taste of other people’s futures or the brine of their secrets on my tongue. I will do it so we all remember what we saw when we were brave enough to look, because memory is the only oar that rows us back to the same shore together. The oil is mixed with salt and rosemary, and it will hold our breath-prints if we let it, but it will sour if we feed it fear dressed as certainty. My tongue carries a thorn and it pricks when I try to sweeten a truth, so take this as clean as I can speak it: the shard will wound someone tonight, and our task is to make sure the cut matches the scar that already exists. I will bind the words to that light and leave the room with only one story to tell, and if any of us tries to tell a different story tomorrow, the lantern will not forgive us. Choose carefully whose face we borrow from the water, because once lifted it cannot be pressed back into the ripple. And remember, even a true reflection shows only one angle of a face; the soul is wider than a shard can hold."

            "title": "Cut Sera Verrin’s reflection from the oil",
            "text": "You angle the shard toward Sera Verrin as she leans, poised and incurious, against the thistle-carved rail, and you watch as the lantern’s breath bows toward her like a courtier. The Glasslake sliver drinks the contour of her mouth and the stillness of her eyes, and in the captured gleam there is the fine-tuned calculus of a woman balancing favors on the edge of a blade. You speak to the room about measuring ambition without mistaking it for guilt, and the lantern stabilizes as if soothed by the absence of panic in her gaze. You tell Sera you will hold her look up like a mirror to every word, and she, to her credit, does not flinch but allows the shard to take her like a signature on a blank line. You feel, in your teeth and tongue-thorn, the faintest resistance, the way a careful liar resists the taste of brine, and you mark it without condemning it, because the lantern does not flicker as it did before. You then set the shard upon the altar, its face now a still coin with Sera’s poise stamped into it, and the vigil flame leans toward it like a flower toward sun.",
            "outcome": "The hearing shifts as if the floor itself has been leveled, and words that would have tumbled into accusation find purchase instead. Under the shard’s gaze, Sera answers questions in sentences that contain more edges than curves, and twice the lantern brightens at a frank admission that other hands would have softened. The ledger-knife’s story grows clearer against that measured light: no stamps touched her palm, but Sera’s faction profited from the fog of panic, and that is not forgery so much as weather-watching. Prior Ansel pauses when the shard briefly dims at a rhetorical flourish, and he adjusts his own questions, curbing zeal with method; the room breathes easier not because it is kinder, but because it is disciplined. Hesk confesses his lapse without being scapegoated, and the Order’s judgment lands on procedural failures at the Exchange rather than on invented villainy, averting a factional fire. When the doors open, Sera nods to you once, a small admission that she has been held to the same flame she brings to others, and later she sends word that your oath-chart will have her voice in committee provided it remains a public trust and not a cudgel. The vigil lantern, perhaps soothed by the taste of her calculated honesty, holds steady until the last oath is written and the shard hums a calmer note as it is returned to its velvet fold."

            "title": "Cut Cal Tesser’s reflection from the oil",
            "text": "You lift the shard as Cal Tesser speaks and let it sip the brightness from her eyes at the precise moment she refuses the word guilty. The glass sings, low and brittle, as if tasting iron under the skin, and you see in the captured light the outline of a jaw set stubbornly against an invisible hand. You tell the room you will measure her craft by the look she wore when she would not sign, and a tremor runs through the lantern like a sob steadied by a palm. Cal’s breath fogs in the memory oil’s curl, and for a heartbeat you feel the burn at the center of your thorned tongue, the solidarity of someone who knows oaths sometimes cut before they heal. You place the shard on the altar cloth, and its hum deepens, not like a hive but like a forge warming, and the flame that had refused to stand now climbs like a tired soldier told to brace. You promise you will not let her profession be mistaken for a crime unless the reflection itself points to it, and the Order nods to your restraint while the Exchange contingent goes very still.",
            "outcome": "The reflection shows more than a face: it hints at a grooved bruise along the inside of the cheek where someone pressed a thumb, and the lantern flares when it passes over a swelling on the tongue that looks like a fresh oath-prick not of her making. Prior Ansel reads the signs aloud, slow as a psalm, and the room tastes the metallic shame of coercion even before Cal steadies and names the corridor where a nameless examiner demanded her confession. Hesk, pale and attentive, admits that corridor fell under his watch during a shift change, and he asks for censure for negligence rather than allowing the blame to drift toward a convenient knife. Sera watches without blinking, then speaks in favor of a joint inquiry that binds the Exchange to the Order’s witnesses for a season, and that unusual alliance keeps the hearing from collapsing into shouted doctrine and ledger-law. The Order declares the confession tainted and sets aside the worst of the charges, replacing them with audits and oaths that will bite if broken; Cal is neither sanctified nor damned but returned to the world under a gaze that will not sleep soon. As the vigil concludes, the lantern holds steady as if satisfied, and the shard’s humming slackens to a purr; Sera sends a clerk with a quiet note promising her conditional support for your oath-chart, noting that a public memory that can unmask coercion is a tool she can defend even among wolves. Cal leaves with a guard at her shoulder and a different light in her eyes, and you leave with the taste of iron and rosemary and the knowledge that tonight the shard chose to save rather than to injure."

            "title": "Cut Floor Marshal Hesk’s reflection from the oil",
            "text": "You angle the shard until it mirrors Hesk’s heavy-lidded stare, and the glass takes him like a river takes a stone, slowly and completely. You speak gently as you capture him, saying that weariness is a truth too, and that truth can be weighed without excusing harm, and he nods as if you have named a familiar ache. The lantern flutters toward him, not from fear but from recognition, because rooms like this often host tired men who choose ease over vigilance, and the flame knows their breath. You fix the shard against the Oathstone’s chipped corner, letting the old vow and the new memory lean on one another until both stand upright. When you set the shard down, its hum shivers into a rhythm like a watchman’s steps, steady when they should be, hurried when they are not, and the entire chamber listens without meaning to. You tell Hesk that his look will hold up every sentence spoken here like a yardstick, and his hands, folded like empty nets, tighten once and then loosen as he lets himself be measured.",
            "outcome": "The reflection catches a blink too long at a door where it should have been short, and the lantern brightens in brief anger when that blink meets the ring of keys on Hesk’s belt, and the truth is neither dramatic nor obscure. It shows no bribe, no whispering hand, only the slow rot of fatigue allowed to call itself policy, and Hesk bows into that truth with a dignity that shames three other men into silence. Prior Ansel uses the moment to shape a judgment that punishes negligence and rebuilds procedure: double-watch at shift changes, named corridors for every oath, and a season of shared oversight between Exchange and Order. Sera, quick as always, steers the conversation away from sacrificing Hesk as a public spectacle and toward committing resources that will make negligence expensive, and the hearing survives because nobody dares to turn a human failing into factional theater under the shard’s steady thrum. The ledger-knife’s confession is set aside as unreliable given the corridor’s lapse, and the focus turns to the counterfeit itself, which the lantern treats like a smoke to be blown away rather than a fire to be fed. When the doors open, Hesk thanks you in the plain language of a worker who knows the cost of his own mistake, and later a sealed note from Sera arrives promising to support your oath-chart on the condition that it binds watchmen and merchants alike to the same light. The lantern, relieved perhaps to have been asked to illuminate a common vice rather than an uncommon villainy, burns without a stutter until the last signature dries."

            "text": "You turn the shard upon the man who called the room to order, and a murmur runs through the pews like a cold draft, but you do not let it stop your hand. Ansel meets the glass without blinking, his jaw set not in defiance but in a weary readiness that tells you he knew this blade might swing back. You explain, voice steady, that authority must be weighed before it weighs others, and that the lantern’s refusal to hold may be a warning that too many oaths have been laid on one side of the scale. The oil drinks the planes of the prior’s face and the shadow of the chipped Oathstone behind him, and a strange harmony arises as if the absent corner were a missing note the shard can almost hear. You set the shard down and feel through your teeth the hum tighten, like a wire tuned to pitch, and the flame climbs with a steadiness that could be called relief. You promise the Order and the Exchange alike that if the lantern dims under Ansel’s words, you will say so without embroidery, and the room, surprised into fairness, leans forward as one body.",
            "outcome": "The reflection shows a man carried by vow and crouched by fear in equal measure, and twice the lantern flares at a word that would have been too sharp if not checked by conscience a beat later. Ansel hears his own zeal as if it were someone else’s song and lowers his spearpoint into a staff, shifting the hearing from inquest to inquiry, and in that pivot the city is spared a quarrel dressed as righteousness. Sera’s eyes soften by degrees seldom seen in her, and she uses the opening to call for an oath of mutual restraint, binding Order and Exchange to procedures that require two lanterns and two signatures where one had been enough. Hesk, spared the worst of posturing, confesses his lapse and accepts discipline without being made a martyr to appease public appetite, and the ledger-knife’s testimony is weighed against a standard that looks more like law and less like theater. The confession is deemed compromised not because Ansel’s authority is impure, but because authority itself was about to outrun its map, and the shard’s honest mirror shamed it back into the channel. When all words are bound, the vigil lantern stands a full hour, brighter than it has in weeks, and Ansel presses a signed commendation into your hand with a look that says he intends to be the first petitioner under your oath-chart lantern should it ever be lit in the Archive. Sera’s later note is warm and unmistakable: the courage to weigh power earns her voice in committee, conditional only on the chart remaining the city’s and not a single house’s."
