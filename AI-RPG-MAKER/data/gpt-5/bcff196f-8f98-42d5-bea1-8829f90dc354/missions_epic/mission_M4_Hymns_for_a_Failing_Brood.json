    "description": "The Loom Cathedral breathed like a great animal, its nave a living throat of timbers and silk, its looms huffing the slow bellows of work too worried to rest. Stained panels shifted from dusk-rose to thistle-blue as the river light crawled across them, and in that trembling light the apprentices kept vigil with moth-frames that should have hummed with soft wings but now lay dull as soot. The blight was not a plague one could pinch between finger and thumb; it was a thinning of hope, ash-gray speckles on eggs and a silence where a song should be, the small despair that makes hands shake at the pedal and tuners doubt their ears. Guildmother Brynna Coil, whose voice could once carry a loom-choir across a ward, wore worry like a veil as she led Kezra beneath the silken clerestory and to the hush of an altar that hid more than prayer. Secrets settled here like dust on an untuned harp, and above them the moth-brood turned in their gauze-cages as if they could smell the question waiting in Kezra’s throat: whose vow would carry the brood back to flight, and whose silence would buy that wind.",

They answer to patience measured in breaths and to gardens kept by hands that remember night dew as a kind of prayer. I have held a secret under this altar like a coal cupped in cloth—smuggled strains brought across half a world at cost I do not tally aloud, and I told myself that the cost was righteous because our veils keep winter wind from sickbeds and paint festivals with hope. But secrecy is an acid even when it eats the right way, and I taste it on my tongue now that the brood falters and the apprentices weep into their dye troughs. Help me, Kezra; help me make a song the moths will trust again, help me bargain honestly with the Willowwives so our hands are not thieves’ hands, and tell me, if you can bear it, whether the secret I have kept is a sin I must confess before it burns the loom that hides it."

The moor-moths fly when we breathe soft and keep our hands empty of wanting, and on the days when our want boils up, they taste it like smoke and turn away. Bring your lantern and set it low so it can listen to the reeds when they mumble in the evening, and you will hear how our hush-songs drape over water the way your silk wants to drape over shoulders. Then we will speak of moth-sense herbs and how much is fair when a brood is failing and fear sits at the table; and I will give you a word you can carry to your guildmother that is not a threat dressed for dinner but a promise with its boots muddy. Remember this: a contract that feeds only one shore starves the other, and in a drought both shores crack alike, so write with a pen that knows hunger from both sides."

The looms believe themselves organs when we let them, and there is no harm in that if our feet remember that breath is time and time is kindness, not conquest. Your step will set the key tonight, and your breath will keep it true while the apprentices count and the moths lean their small minds toward the wind your song promises. If you slip, the brood will not fall out of the world, no, they will simply learn to turn their listening elsewhere, and once they learn another throat, it is three hard seasons to coax them back. Set your heel like a metronome, keep your ribs wide, and when the pedal murmurs back at you with that little ache that feels like grief, that is the place where you set your lantern to remembering."

I do not come to parade your hidden vault before the Hall of Shares or grind your guilt into paste for the Exchange; I come with the Oathstone’s weight in my hand and the city’s first vows in my mouth, because vows are chains we choose to wear. Tell me what lives beneath your altar, Guildmother, and I will keep it under the Order’s fast until its weight is one we agree to carry together, not one you stoop under alone. Kezra, you were taught to see with one eye that loves light and one that loves shadow—do not let either eye blind the other while the river runs low and tongues grow quick. And hear this as warning, not as threat: when silence tastes of ash, the reeds whisper strange things, and the vow that saves today can drown tomorrow if no witness stands to sound the depth."

I will write a contract that can be lived with when the river forgets itself and surges and when it crouches down to shine stones in the drought, and I will leave room in its margins for mercy that does not humiliate. If a secret here is a knife’s bright edge, then let us wrap its handle in a cloth all hands agree to hold, so if it cuts, it cuts no one by surprise. My lantern will remember the pattern we make, and the pattern will not be hoarded in a pocket but hung where those who need it can find it, with oaths around it like river stones to slow greedy fingers. And when we speak with the Order, or choose not to, I will carry the words on a tongue already pricked by thorn, because I swore once to bind my craft to the city’s good, and I mean to keep that vow even if it asks me to count the cost aloud."

            "text": "Kezra resolves to notify the Order of the Black Thistle about the seed-vault beneath the altar and asks Prior Ansel to witness any use of it until the blight has passed. They speak at length of why a hidden boon can curdle into a private tyranny even under gentle hands, and they set the terms in plain ink so that no one can pretend not to understand. Kezra admits the smuggling to the degree necessary without naming the distant monastery, framing it as a mercy that now requires shared stewardship rather than solitary penance. In the nave that evening, Kezra explains the choice to the apprentices in careful, patient sentences, so that shame does not take root in the places where music should grow. With the Order’s eyes present, the hymn-tuning is not a performance but a rite, and the moths begin to stir as if the lanternlight itself has been relieved of a lie.",
            "outcome": "Brynna’s shoulders loosen, but only after a long silence, and she thanks Kezra with a voice that sounds scraped raw, admitting that relief and humiliation are wound together in her. The Order places a sealed token on the altar that signifies joint stewardship; it feels heavy as a low river, yet the apprentices sing with steadier breath, and a rumor floats through the Loom Quarter that the reed-thing’s whispers avoid the Cathedral’s eaves for a week. Ossa Wreath sends a message reed-wrapped: trust increases when secrets stand in the weather, and she offers herbs at a price that is fair rather than sharpened by suspicion. The Hall of Shares mutters at first about overreach, then prices the stability of an Order-witnessed brood; their mutters soften when the first clean cocoons roll in without ash spots. Night Cartographers lose leverage on this thread; a broker touches his map-lantern and finds the route he drew toward blackmail now ending at a lamp kept lit by public vow."

            "text": "Kezra decides that disclosure to the Order in this moment would trade a brood’s timing for a season of spectacle, and spectacle kills more quietly than blight. They tell Brynna that the secret will be guarded a while longer, but not alone: a contract with Ossa Wreath and the Willowwives will braid obligation so that smugness cannot take up residence. Kezra spends a long afternoon in the Mire with their lantern dimmed and the reed-flute folded in their lap, learning the pauses inside Ossa’s hush-songs until they can write them in ink without stealing them. In return for herbs and patient ears, Kezra offers a public ledger entry that names the Willowwives as co-authors of the season’s hymn-pattern, placing their names where the Hall of Shares must trip over them. They return to the nave at dusk and tune the pedals with hands that shake not from fear but from the weight of choosing to carry a secret one day longer.",
            "outcome": "The brood responds as if a hand finally stopped fussing with their cage, and a fine gray dust lifts from the eggs like regret, leaving clarity behind. Brynna’s gratitude is fierce and private; the apprentices, who are kinder than the Exchange, lace offerings into Kezra’s scarf and sing their names into the lantern’s oil. Prior Ansel’s gaze cools; he says little, but the Order’s procession pauses outside the Loom Cathedral three mornings running as if smelling weather, and a vigil lantern at Black Thistle House gutters once before catching again. Ossa’s esteem for Kezra increases, and in the Mire a Willowwife child murmurs that the city finally learned a listening step; a reed-thing rumor grows teeth that same night in the Floodwalk, as if the hush of a secret drew something curious to the eaves. The Night Cartographers scent a hidden ember and circle with offers, but Kezra’s oath-glyphs on the contract sour when read by a liar, and a would-be broker spends a day with a tongue too numb to speak."

            "text": "Kezra proposes a third path: the seed-vault remains out of public mouths but is bound under a two-key stewardship—one held by the Loom Cathedral and one by the Willowwives—while a sealed affidavit naming the truth is lodged with the Concord of Chapels for release under agreed conditions. They draft a compact where harvests, hymns, and herbs are measured not in coin first but in seasons and pains borne, and they invite Prior Ansel to write the condition under which the affidavit will open so that suspicion has a hinge and does not splinter into rumor. The negotiation is long, with pauses for tea, rain, and pride to cool, but Kezra insists that all signers speak aloud what they fear losing most so the document can remember it. When the text is done, they hold it over the Lantern Archive’s running water so the words learn to resist smearing, and they light a memory flame so that absences will be noticed. In the nave, the hymn that night sounds less like a plea and more like a promise, and the moths come down to rest as if roofs were soft hands.",
            "outcome": "Trust grows in the spaces between factions like moss on stone, quiet and persistent, and it holds fast even when a Hall factor tries to pry. Brynna finds her voice carrying again, stronger for having been shared, and Ossa laughs in a way that shakes the chaff from her hair when she tells the Willowwives that cityfolk learned to keep a promise without swallowing it. Prior Ansel’s mouth almost smiles; he mutters that a vow with measured release is better than a secret with no shore, and he places an Order seal on the affidavit that will crack only when drought rites are invoked twice in a season. The Night Cartographers are left with a map that points to a lock with two keys they cannot purchase, and their price rises above their appetite; in response, they send Kezra a quiet apology folded into a chart-scrap, which is as close as they come to respect. The brood recovers on a curve that can be taught, the lantern pattern enters the Archive’s public shelf under oath-ink, and apprentices in seasons to come will hum the shared-key cadence without remembering the day it was born, which is the best memorial a city can give."

            "text": "Kezra, sleepless and hearing the silence of failing wings as if it were water lapping at the ribs, takes out the glass shard from the Glasslake and the salt-ring and whispers the breath-name they once traded in the Mourning Mire. They do this in a small room behind the nave where dust does not settle and where mirrors are normally veiled, and the air grows cold as though the city remembers a drowned queen’s footsteps passing under its bridges. Kezra asks not for power but for listening, for the kind of wind inside a song that living things choose to follow, and in answer a thin reed-scented hush spills like ink into the lantern’s flame. They carry this hush to the pedals and play with a steadiness that is not entirely their own, and the moths bank and settle as if a long journey ended in a familiar hand. When the last note fades, the room is theirs again, but a handful of shadows do not return to their owners at once, and one apprentice dreams of reeds for a week.",
            "outcome": "The brood is saved quickly and cleanly, and Brynna’s gratitude burns bright, but Kezra feels the cost in the way their tongue catches on the thorn of their oath as if it had grown a new barb. Ossa’s eyes narrow when she hears a reed-toned overtone in the hymn and she says nothing harsh, only counsels that debts to the Mire should be paid in stories and visits before they sour into something larger. Prior Ansel tastes river-cold in the nave and does not press it, but he asks Kezra to walk the Needle’s base with him at dusk so the Order can listen for echoes in the rain-chains, for sometimes favors leave wakes. Night Cartographers sniff at a rumor of shadowless singers and decide the price of that map would be less than the cost of carrying it; instead, they send a warning that such threads can tangle feet in flood season. The lantern pattern Kezra captures is true and strong, but when copied it carries a faint scent of willow and still water that audiences either love as peace or distrust as silence, and that ambivalence becomes part of Thornspire’s music for a while."
