    "city": "Thornspire is a river-crowned city built in a ring around a basalt needle thrusting from the floodplain of the Low Veyne. The river splits and braids beneath the city, guided through stone weirs and tide-gates into canals that power mills and carry barges to market. The basalt pillar at its heart is banded with old fortifications and scaffolded terraces, culminating in the Needle Keep, a citadel of black stone and green-copper roofs that glimmer when the river mists burn away at noon. Thornspire was founded three centuries ago, when refugees from a failed coastal principality sought safety inland and swore oaths to a hermit-knight whose banner bore a thorned thistle. The first palisade was built at the base of the basalt pillar, and the earliest canals were hacked by hand, guided by borrowed dwarven surveyor lenses. Those humble bulwarks grew into a tiered city whose lower wards work and flood, whose middle terraces trade and feast, and whose upper galleries read, scheme, and pray. The city’s lifeblood is threefold: thorn-silk spun from moor-moths farmed in the foggy mires north of the walls; salt and alchemical ash ferried from the Salt Ever along caravan trails; and iron and basalt from the Skygrind Steps, where ancient quarries still ring under dwarven contracts. These goods meet in the Weir Market and the Salt Crown Exchange, and from there flow outward by river to downriver city-states and upriver hill towns. The governance of Thornspire is a counterweighted machine. A Lord or Lady Protector holds the Needle Keep and commands the city watch and walls, but their purse is light without the approval of the Hall of Shares, a council of guild factors and shipwrights who direct tariffs and festivals. Offsetting both is the Concord of Chapels led by the Order of the Black Thistle, a militant ascetic chapter who claim stewardship of the city’s origin vows and keep vigil against demonic whispers said to haunt the reeds whenever the river runs low. In practice, the Protector’s decrees must pass the Hall’s purse and the Order’s scrutiny, or risk a season of strikes, closed gates, and shuttered shrines. Thornspire’s neighborhoods speak their stories in stone. The Floodwalk is a low-ward of stilted homes built over canal lattices, draped with fishing nets and lantern strings; residents memorize floodmarks carved into door lintels and keep skiffs tied to bedroom ladders. Above lies the Loom Quarter, a humming hive of spinneries whose rooftop gardens are planted with night-blooming thistle to attract moths to silken veils. The Ember Gate ward faces the quarries and houses the smithies, foundries, and chain-yards, kept warm by furnaces fed with coke that scents the air with bitter sweetness. Eastward, the Scribes’ Stair spirals around the basalt pillar, each landing lined with script-shops, contract offices, and schools; at its apex hangs the Lantern Archive, a library whose lamps are said to remember the faces of lost readers. Thornspire’s festivals are timed to the river and the moth. During Fogfast, children in waxed cloaks carry reed flutes through the Floodwalk to lure the first moor-moths home. During the Uncasked Evening, salt-workers pour trickles of precious brine from casks into the river to appease the drowned queen of a lost city reputedly buried under the downstream silt. In high summer, the Black Thistle chapter opens their reliquary and walks the Needle with a procession of thistle-wreathed pennons, reminding all that vows bind coin as tightly as chains. The city’s legends reach further back. Learned elders murmur that the basalt needle is the tip of a petrified spear hurled by a storm-god to pin a river demon beneath the clay; fishermen claim they can feel the demon thrash in drought years. The Night Cartographers whisper of a map cut into the Needle’s shadow at midsummer that reveals a path through the Mourning Mire to a mirror of the city under black water. Dependencies lace Thornspire’s security. Its fleets of flat-bottomed barges rely on the Riverlight Pilots to navigate hidden sandbars and eel-nests; without them, markets starve in a week. The thorn-silk guild keeps contracts with the Willowwives of the mires to propagate the delicate moths, and when blight strikes the thistle crops, the Loom Quarter goes silent and lenders turn predatory. Salt caravans must pass the Sunken Road and its ancient statues—when storms swallow that causeway, alchemists’ crucibles go cold and the city’s glass and soap grow scarce. Thornspire’s walls are stout and its ward gates are iron-shod, but its greatest defense is the river itself and the draw-bridges that can isolate each district. Its greatest threat is also the river—when the Low Veyne forgets itself and surges, it will take whatever the city has been careless enough to build below the floodmark. Politics in Thornspire is a garden of brambles. Guilds contest tariffs and the right to tithe canal traffic; mercantile houses duel by embargo; the Order of the Black Thistle denounces sorcerers and quietly hires some when it must; and the Lord Protector balances favors with writs. The present Protector, Arelon Vale, rose from the Pilots Brotherhood, and so faces a suspicious Hall of Shares led by Matron Selde of the Salt Factors League, whose caravans feed two-thirds of the Exchange. Meanwhile, a masked society called the Night Cartographers trades in routes, rumors, and blackmail—if a city can be mapped, it can be measured, and if it can be measured, it can be priced. Thornspire’s current tensions include a drought upriver lowering barges and raising tempers; a moth-blight that has forced the Loom Quarter to import cocoons at ruinous rates; and a spate of canal murders blamed on a reed-thing that leaves thistle bundles on doorsteps. The city remembers, always, that oaths built it, trade feeds it, and the river can take it back.",
