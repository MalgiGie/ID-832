The tri-fold compact lies open in the Lantern Archive’s traveling case, its ink not quite dry. Below, the river braids and unbraids like hands worrying a prayer. The reed-thing comes at last into full sight: not a monster from elsewhere, but a man-shape woven of broken oath-threads, its mouth a slit of moving reeds, its eyes wet with borrowed promises. Kezra must read the rain-chains’ song aloud as a map, set the iron to humming in the right key, stitch the Oathstone’s missing corner with the relic-needle, and use the lens to cut the demon’s reflected path in water—severing it from the city’s shadow.
