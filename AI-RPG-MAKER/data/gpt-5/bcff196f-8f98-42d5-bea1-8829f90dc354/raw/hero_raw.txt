A scholarship from the Scribes' Stair put them to work fetching memory oils and copying tide ledgers in the Lantern Archive, where Lantern-keeper Sula Reedmantle taught them the ethics of remembrance. Kezra's knack for drawing thought into light and water grew into a careful art: lantern mnemonics, oath-glyphs in ink that soured when read by liars, and reflections coaxed to reveal what they had seen. The Order of the Black Thistle called it practical sorcery and demanded vows; Kezra bent the tongue to a thorn and swore to bind their magic to the city's good. When the drought upriver bit the barges low, Master Pilot Olan Vetch hired Kezra to annotate route-books with lantern patterns and to stand as a neutral eye on moving sandbars. On one moonless tow, a submerged ridge the pilots call the demon's spine shifted; Kezra's quick reading of the current saved a barge and bought Olan's enduring respect. Rumor later spread that Kezra had cut a reflected map from a chart-lantern's face to learn a rival's route in a pinch. Sula Reedmantle warned that such cuts leave scars not only on water. Kezra's work since has straddled canal and archive: arbitrating between bargemen and stallholders after bellweights were discovered to be false, advising the Loom Cathedral on moth-lantern harmonics during Fogfast, and walking the Needle when the rain-chains sang without wind. In a low year, Kezra took a flatboat north to the Mourning Mire to negotiate with Willowwives over thistle beds. Lost among reed-banks and ghost lights, they whispered a true price to a presence in bone-white reeds and were shown out by a new waterway straight as a spear. Kezra did not speak the encounter aloud. Now, with moth blight, counterfeit salt, and a reed-thing haunting canals, Kezra seeks to bind oath, chart, and lantern into a public commonplace the guilds cannot hoard, even as the Night Cartographers circle with offers priced in favors measured by the ell.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mnemonic chart-lantern\",\n      \"description\": \"A brass-and-glass river lantern whose oil is tinctured with rosemary and salt.
