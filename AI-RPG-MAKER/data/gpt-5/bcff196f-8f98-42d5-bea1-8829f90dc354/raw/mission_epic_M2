The sluice below Stall 47 breathes a thin thread of current that smells of dark salt and oiled rope, and in that breath floats a body whose coat has learned more of water than any man should. Thistle bundles bloom like small crowns on doorsteps from the Floodwalk to the first stair of the Loom Quarter, their stems clipped too evenly and their knots mimicking penitent loops that do not belong to common grief. Rumor, that tireless barge, carries a cargo of shape and gives the reed-thing a long body and a slit mouth that drinks vows out of the air, passing tavern to tavern until even the watch speaks lower at canal corners. The Order of the Black Thistle demands a witness who can lay words in straight lines and bind their wriggle to the lantern’s calm, for trade is hungry, panic is cheap, and the river’s face remembers when the city forgets. Kezra must read the thistle knots like a ledger of intentions, survey the eddies where truth snags on pilings, and persuade the living to speak as cleanly as the dead’s water-logged clothes whisper when wrung. Above, the rain-chains of the Needle Keep hum a tune that belongs to windless nights, and the Oathstone’s corner sweats salt in the Black Thistle House as if a tongue had licked it in a dare. Between breath and bargain, between reed and rope, there is a channel, and it is narrow enough to ground a city if steered poorly. Kezra sets the mnemonic lantern, wets the sounding lead with salt, and aims to draw a clean chart through a morning that would rather be mud.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Examine the crime scenes at the Floodwalk, the contraband sluice, and a lamplit alley near the Loom Quarter.\",\n        \"Use the oath-glyph kit to test the thistle bundles for vow-resonance and record any souring when lies are spoken nearby.\",\n        \"Confer with Sister Meret, oath-reader, about the reed-thing stories; establish what is rumor and what is ritual.\",\n        \"Deliver your findings at a small hearing in Black Thistle House, keeping the Hall of Shares from co-opting the conclusion.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Finn Bracken\", \"lines\": \"It’s not just a bad tide, Kezra, it is as if the water tucked its chin and held still to listen for its own name. The river’s quieter around them, like it’s holding its breath, and I have rowed through drought years enough to know when the Veyne is pretending to be a mirror rather than a mouth. I don’t like bodies where the sluices run because truth has too many planks to slide beneath and too many chains to snag an ankle, and Stall 47 is the slipperiest of the lot. Those thistle bundles look like ‘I remember’ to folk who want to believe in mercy, but to me they read ‘I accuse’ when I count the clipped stems and smell dye on the leaves. Come see what the boards have to say, and bring your lantern-grammar, but don’t bring bells, because bells are for endings and I hope this is not the last word. If the reed-thing is real, it knows our oaths better than some guild clerks, and if it is a mask, then someone behind it chews reeds and laughs in dark water.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sister Meret\", \"lines\": \"The thistles are twisted in a penitent’s knot, but the stem breaks are wrong, too clean and too uniform, as if a measure-board clipped them and not a hand that trembled with loss. When I read them, the taste on the tongue is like dark salt, the sort that stains the lips in the Exchange vaults, and not the sweet blanched kind we scatter at baptisms. If a vow is being drunk, it is being drunk by something that knows ceremonies well enough to mock them and to ring them like bells until we mistake the echo for a hymn. Reed spirits, demons, and memories all like to wear our shapes and borrow our words, and the quickest way to feed them is to pretend they do not exist while acting as if they do. Keep your oath-glyph kit ready, for the sour will bloom different when a liar speaks than when a grief-struck heart stumbles, and I will stand beside you and read aloud until the words hold still. If the rain-chains sing at noon again, look to the Oathstone’s sweat, because vows are weather, and something may be drawing a storm through our mouths.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Matron Selde Karst\", \"lines\": \"The Exchange has no patience for ghost tales that spook barge-crews from their duties, because spooked crews tie knots in coin-flows faster than any storm and we all drown in famine scrip when stories pull harder than oars. Bodies are tragedies, and tragedies in turn depress prices, and prices are the riverbed on which the city builds its mills and prayers, so you will forgive me if I demand stone rather than mist. Bring me a culprit in flesh and a motive inscribed with a ledger hand, and then we can speak of justice; I will not seek justice in reeds and rotary superstition while caravans stall and weighmen flinch. If the contraband sluice under Stall 47 is entangled in this, then it is entangled because rivals made it so, and I will not have the Salt Factors be the goat hung in a thistle crown to appease rumor. Give your findings at the House if you must, but remember that the Hall of Shares weighs testimony as it weighs salt, and I am very good at proving that panic is just a tariff in costume. Choose your words like anchors, Kezra, because I will count the links.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Prior Ansel of the Black Thistle\", \"lines\": \"Do not let the Hall shame grief into bargaining, for once sorrow is priced it will be bought and sold until there is nothing left but receipts and a city that has forgotten why it swore itself together. If this is a thing of promises, it will feed on our denials as easily as our confessions, because both are flavors of fear and both carry a breath of worship when we speak them too carefully. Speak what you found, Kezra, and be braced, for the first defense of a city is the truth it admits in public, before the candles and the lanterns and the faces that will remember. The reed demon, if that old spear-point tale still has teeth, loves nothing more than a hush dressed up as prudence, and we have been too polite with our silences of late. I can lend you relic-lances that hum at false tongues and sisters who will read oaths until blood answers, but the chosen measure is your own, and the Oathstone sweats thicker when you hesitate. Bring the river to heel by naming what it carries, and let the Hall’s bellweights clatter in their own embarrassment.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kezra Thorneglass\", \"lines\": \"I can bind a few words to the lantern’s light and ask them not to wriggle, but I can’t conjure a murderer out of gossip, and I won’t let hunger for neat endings drown what the water actually says. The knots remember a careful hand, and the water remembers silence, and I have learned to read both with a sounding lead and a patience I stole from Sula’s oil-lit aisles. Clothes soak up quarrels and secrets like dye, and when you wring them over a silver bowl you can sometimes hear the threads choose which memory to keep, and I will listen with clean fingers. The rain-chains’ tune is back in my ears like a headache I once bought at the Glasslake, and I will mark every change in the humming as if it were a shifting sandbar beneath a starving barge. Between the clipped stem and the bruised throat there is a path, and if I can walk it without breaking the reeds that lean over it, I may get us home without selling our names to the fog. I will walk it, and I will speak plain without dressing sorrow for market.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Sound the Quiet Water\", \"text\": \"You choose to make the test a spectacle of truth rather than a secret, setting your mnemonic chart-lantern on a crate in the Weir Market where the spray falls into a silver bowl and keeps the flame honest. Sister Meret stands at your shoulder with a psalter of oaths and her tongue pricked raw, and Finn Bracken stalks the periphery with a hook-pole to fish any sudden guilt from under planks. You press thistle stems into wax and trace glyphs that sour at deceit, then invite stallholders, pilots, and weighmen to speak what they have heard in the order you call, so rumor cannot braid itself into a rope. Matron Selde watches from the sand-pit edge with a clerk counting breaths the way he counts bricks of salt, and more than one barge-hand fingers a charm as if your lantern were a storm. When the river hushes at the second whistle pattern and the rain mists brighten the silk awnings, you read the eddies under the words as carefully as you would read a moving sandbar after midnight.\", \"outcome\": \"The oath-glyphs pucker at a weighman’s too-smooth timeline, and the lantern shows a dull green band where truth should be clear, prompting a murmur that tastes like old copper. Under your questions the man flinches and confesses to planting several thistle bundles at dawns chosen to stoke a reed-thing panic, paid by a faceless agent who delivered coin through the Exchange’s thieves’ market of favors. Finn traces the coin to the contraband sluice watchers, and your sounding lead returns a telltale smear of ash and ledger wax that does not belong to river work, revealing the play was to spook crews and drive pilotage to cheaper independents while the Hall prepared new licenses. The dead man’s clothes, wrung over your silver bowl, tell a different story, whispering of a struggle in a lamplit alley and a debt chain that cinched tighter than the river’s pull, putting a human hand on the murder and leaving the reed-thing as a mask rather than a mouth. Prior Ansel steps forward before the Hall can pounce and names the finding as a public sorrow, not a tariff, and Sister Meret binds a penitent cord to the weighman’s wrist as the crowd witnesses. The Order thanks you in the open square and calls your name before the lanterns, Finn presses ferry-markers into your palm with a grin as broad as the Veyne, and a small reliquary pin from the House warms near a guildsworn falsehood as you leave the market to its new, uneasy honesty.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Walk the Sluice at Drownlight\", \"text\": \"You wait for drownlight, that boundary after sunset when the river’s skin forgets the sky and remembers its debts, and you follow Finn under the Weir Market to Stall 47 where the contraband sluice exhales cool breath. You wrap your sound-damping silk scarf and set your lantern low, then draw your Glasslake reflection-shard along the bowl to cut a thin image of a thistle bundle’s knot from a basin of still water, an act close enough to theft that your tongue-thorn tugs. You seat the stolen image in the lantern’s face where a vow might see itself reflected and come to feed, while Sister Meret and two thistle-brothers wait upstream with lances that hum when lies lean close. The sluice boards creak, the river hushes, and a shape gathers out of sheen and reed-scent, long as a man with a slit of a mouth that tastes the vow-light and pulls it in slow as a bead on a string. It whispers back the lies spoken today in a collage of market voices, and then it flinches at a breath that stinks of ash-vaults and ledger-ink, turning not toward you but toward shadowed listeners on the planks.\", \"outcome\": \"The watchers who thought themselves unseen bolt, and Finn’s pole fouls a boot while your lantern’s glow shows the glint of Exchange stamp-seals on their knives, making guild deniability look very thin indeed. One bravo, caught between humming lance and cold water, babbles about a payment chain and a plan to stir panic until the Hall could license independents and tilt pilotage toward House-bought boats, and his fear is so keen the reed-shape tries to drink it and chokes. The creature collapses into a ribbon of wet shadow that slides away along a current you cannot follow, leaving you with the knowledge that something ritual-savvy is nearby but not the killer’s final name. At the hearing, Matron Selde scours the sand-pit with language hard as salt, yet the relic-lances thrum when her proxy tries to reframe the story, and Prior Ansel names what you caught a wound in the city’s vow-skin that requires binding, not pricing. The Order’s thanks are public and plain, the ferry-markers from Finn bear the Pilots’ rivet-scratches and will pass you through three canal wards without a tithe, and the reliquary pin warms like a heartbeat when a sworn mouth tries to turn truth aside. You do not sleep well for three nights because the Glasslake-cut image left a tide-mark in your dreams, but the river runs a little truer where the sluice coughs.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bind a Three-Guild Compact\", \"text\": \"You take the fight to the words themselves, shaping the hearing in Black Thistle House into a circle that no faction can easily square, and you ask the Order to let you lay an oath-glyph compass on the chapel floor. Olan Vetch arrives at your quiet request and scratches pilot whistle-marks by the north point while a Spindlewright aide knots a weaver’s line at the east, and Sister Meret pricks her tongue and sets a thorn-thread down the center. You propose that testimony be weighed by souring glyphs and cross-read by a pilot’s memory and a loom’s pattern, creating a braid of truth harder to fray than a single strand, and you insist that the Exchange’s clerk be seated where the lantern light falls sharpest. The Hall of Shares bristles and tries to turn the hearing into a pricing session, but Prior Ansel’s presence and the murmuring of the common folk gathered in the chapel galleries hold the space to its vow-shaped purpose. You read the findings as a navigation chart, naming the thistle-plantings as deliberate rumor work and the death as a debt-driven crime, and you bind the reed-thing as an unknown influence to be warded against rather than a scapegoat to be fed.\", \"outcome\": \"The compact passes under watch of relic-lances and pilot marks, binding the Order to set lantern-wards near the sluices, the Pilots to ferry witnesses in drought without fee, and the Exchange to accept impartial auditors on incidents that stink of ritual until the fog lifts. Matron Selde signs with a grain of dark salt on the chapel stone and swallows her bitterness with public grace, because the room’s eyes would remember otherwise and the lanterns never go out once lit for a reader, and her clerk whispers that fines are cheaper than a riot. The city breathes easier for a week as thistle bundles vanish from doorsteps and rumor meets the resistance of a recorded oath, even while the river keeps its secrets about the shape that kissed your lantern. The Order thanks you before the gathered ward, and the applause tastes like wet iron and relief, and they pin a small reliquary thorn to your cloak that warms whenever a speaker steps close to breaking the compact. Finn claps you on the shoulder and presses ferry-markers into your hand with a grin, promising three wards of quick passage and a quiet boast to pilots who respect a clean chart. Your standing among common folk rises like a good flood, and the Hall’s attempt to co-opt the ending drowns in the record you stitched into the chapel floor.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M1\"], \"next\": [\"M3\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Public thanks from the Order of the Black Thistle, improving standing among common folk who witnessed the hearing and speak your name with steady voices.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"passage\", \"description\": \"Riverlight Pilots ferry-markers from Finn Bracken granting free passage between three canal wards without tithe or question.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"trinket\", \"description\": \"A small reliquary pin from Black Thistle House that subtly warms near oath-breaking, a quiet clue toward crooked tongues in future scenes.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
