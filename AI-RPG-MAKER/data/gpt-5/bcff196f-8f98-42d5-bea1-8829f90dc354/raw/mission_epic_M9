Barges and skiffs that dare its glassy cut return with cargos intact and oarsmen pale, for each traveler steps ashore without a shadow and without the easy laughter that shadows keep. The Willowwives murmur that this is a hunger, not a path, and that the drowned queen’s memory stirs, tasting for names the way the river tastes for salt. Long ago a relic-needle was pried from the Order’s reliquary and hidden in a peat-cache, and the queen’s memory wants it returned, fed with a name that rings true, before she will unclench her grip and allow safe passage without toll. Ossa Wreath calls on Kezra Thorneglass, whose breath once warmed a reed with a price whispered in fear, to walk the ghost-lit channels, to refuse clever lies that starve a season later, to speak a true name without breaking, and to write an Accord that lets both city and mire live in a bargain that feels like standing together on one raft while the river rises. In the Lantern Archive the oils remember older droughts, the Pilots’ whistles have taken a lower, wary note, and the Order’s thistles prickle at the thought of parley with a sorrow in a crown of reeds; still, the city depends on routes as much as on vows, and this mission threads both.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Locate the peat-cache where the relic-needle is hidden by following ghost lights that mimic lanterns—without being led astray.\",\n        \"Parley with the drowned queen’s memory at the straight waterway; offer a true name and bind terms for safe passage.\",\n        \"Write and witness a renewed Willowwife Accord that protects both city and mire from predatory terms.\",\n        \"Return the relic-needle to the Order under conditions that respect Willowwife rites.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ossa Wreath\", \"lines\": \"You walked our reeds once and left a breath of your name on them, Kezra, and the stems still lean when you pass as if listening for the rest. The queen’s memory tastes the air when the lanterns go out, and she is patient the way peat is patient, turning years into fuel unless someone remembers the first fire was a promise. Bring the needle back from its wet hiding and do not let the Order pound its return into a sermon that taxes us until we must lie to eat. Bargain with a name that costs you without breaking you, because payment that ruins the payer is just another story the reeds tell about city-folk who drown standing up. If you must write, write like a pilot setting poles under everyone’s feet at once, and if you must bleed a word, make it one you can live with when the moths come home in Fogfast and the children ask why the water sings their names at night.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"The Drowned Queen's Memory\", \"lines\": \"I am not a demon, little oath-binder, though the Order’s lances would be happier if I wore horns you could polish and hang. I am the meal the river keeps eating and serving again, the taste of vows washed thin until they break into brine, the patience of weeds that grow through your stone and call it mercy when they hold you up. Names are salt and songs together, and I am hungry, because every dry season your measures weigh us and call it fairness and every flood year your bridges call it fate. Do not bring me the name you wear in markets and halls, the one that buys respect like soap; bring me the name you tasted in your mouth when you were lost and no one was listening, the one that wicks tears into strength. Feed me such a name with the needle’s point laid on still water, and I will let the children find the long way home without losing their shadows, and I will let pilots who whistle wrong live long enough to learn the right tune, and I will remember that mercy is a kind of geometry that can be mapped if the map is brave.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Prior Ansel Thornward\", \"lines\": \"We do not traffic lightly with river masks or sorrowed memories, for the city’s vows were cut to spare the living an unending negotiation with what drowns and what whispers. And yet, I have seen the Exchange tally grief into ledgers and the Hall of Shares price absolution by the ell, and I will not pretend the Keep’s rain-chains sing only hymns I approve. Bring back the relic, yes, and if you must bargain then bind the bargain to your own breath and bones so that no innocent pays a tithe you agreed without their hearing. We will witness, because light shies from unobserved vows, and we will insist that the needle’s return be received under Willowwife rites, because a debt returned with scorn is not settled, it is salted. Mind this too, Kezra Thorneglass: oaths are scaffolds, not cages, and if you build this Accord like a scaffold, I will help stand watch against the ones who climb it to take aim at the reed-women who kept us in silk when the moths were dying.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kezra Thorneglass\", \"lines\": \"I have a name I have never written, a name kept for nights when the water in my bowl shows me a sky full of futures I will not buy, and when I speak it even the thorn under my tongue pricks like a memory of winter. I will feed that name to you on a still surface with the relic’s point resting like a compass needle, and I will not flinch, because fear is a poor scribe and bargains written in fear blur when the ink dries. In return, we will set terms that refrain from drowning anyone slowly with clever measures, a passage kept by tokens woven in bone-white reeds and renewed by the first moths of Fogfast, so that safe ways are not hoarded as secrets but tended as common vows. Ossa, I will write the Accord like it is a raft we all must stand on at once, ward and mire together, and I will argue it until the Hall stops playing at famine and the Order stops pretending that hunger is a test of faith we should all pass. Prior, I will let you witness and strike your thorn on my tongue if I shade a truth, and I will return the needle under rites that taste of peat and river smoke, because a relic that forgets its making will only remember how to hurt.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Breathe the True Name\", \"text\": \"Kezra sets a dark bowl on the spear-straight water where it touches the old channel, rings the lip with a trembling line of salt, and lowers the relic-needle so its reflection becomes a second, downward-pointing thorn. The hush-silk is wrapped at the throat and the mnemonic lantern is turned down to a low memory, and in that held quiet Kezra speaks the breath-name that only the reeds and the empty midnight heard before. It tastes of peat smoke and childhood fear and the clean ache after a rescue, and the thorn under the tongue pierces as if it has found the first vow again. Ossa hums a Willowwife cradle-tone and Prior Ansel pricks his own tongue in solidarity, and the ghost lights gather like witnesses rather than bait. The queen’s memory listens without moving the water, and the straight-cut channel softens at the edges, and when the name is finished the bowl’s reflection lifts as if it wants to be kept forever but accepts instead the promise of return. \", \"outcome\": \"The Drowned Queen’s Memory accepts the true name and takes only a sliver of its salt, and shadows step back to their owners like dogs called in from the yard at dusk. She yields a token woven of bone-white reeds and sealed with a wet imprint of the needle’s tip, declaring that those who carry it will be shown the slower, safer curves of the Mire without paying with light or laughter. The Accord is written in firm strokes and witnessed by Willowwives and Order alike, setting passages by season, forbidding predatory tariffs, and naming a public lantern at the Weir Market whose pattern grants access without guild toll. Kezra feels lighter and a little hollow, and for a season their reflection lags a heartbeat behind and their shadow is thin at noon, but the cost is theirs and harms no other; the Willowwives call it honorable hunger. The relic-needle is returned to the Order in Ossa’s hands under peat-smoke and thistle prayers, strengthening trust between chapel and mire; in the weeks that follow the moth-frames thrive, pilots speak of lights that warn instead of lure, and the Night Cartographers quietly raise their prices on secret routes they can no longer claim are the only safe ways.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Name the City’s Founding Vow\", \"text\": \"Kezra kneels with the relic-needle on the Oathstone rub carried from the Lantern Archive, and recites the first, rough-cut vow that raised the palisade against flood and famine. The drowned queen’s memory is invited to taste that vow through the water, and to bind her hunger not to one person but to the city’s promise when it remembers itself and to the lanterns that remember what water tries to erase. Prior Ansel lends the Order’s breath to the recitation, and Ossa threads a Willowwife reed through the knot so that the compact’s weight sits where river and stone meet, not where coin and ledger argue. Kezra keeps personal names sheathed and instead offers stewardship in the open, a schedule of rites at Fogfast and Uncasked Evening, and a ledger of reparations to be paid in work and seed rather than in bare coin. The ghost lights sway like a congregation in a steady wind, and the straight waterway waits like an unstruck bell for the queen’s answer. \", \"outcome\": \"The queen accepts a lesser tasting of the city’s founding vow and agrees to grant safe passage to those who carry a reed token stamped at a public lantern, but she declares that any season the city breaks its rites she will take shadows again until the vow is reheard. The Order is mollified by the public nature of the compact and gains ceremonial oversight of the lantern witnessings, which pleases some and worries others who fear sermons drifting into tolls. The Willowwives accept the Accord with reserve, glad for the protections against predatory terms but watchful that the Hall of Shares does not turn witness into leverage; Kezra crafts language that requires Willowwife assent on any changes. The relic-needle is returned under a shared rite, and its presence in the reliquary hums only when someone contemplates breaking the compact, which the Order admits is useful even as it keeps them honest. In the months following, safe passage stabilizes, moth-supply steadies, and although a few independent pilots grumble about new rites at the water’s edge, drownings drop and the river feels less like a trap set by clever men and more like a road held in common.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Cheat the Reeds with a Masked Name\", \"text\": \"Tempted by the Night Cartographers’ old whisper that maps are only as true as the price paid for them, Kezra fashions a mask-name from a rumor and an oath-glyph, stitching it with hush-silk and breath held too long. The ghost lights lean close like curious children, and the bowl of water takes the false reflection easily, because water loves light more than truth. For a moment it seems the queen is satisfied, shadows jerk toward their owners like loose kites snagged by a gust, and the spear-cut channel flexes as if to become a road instead of a wound. Ossa watches in worried silence, knowing that cheaters of the mire often pay later, and Prior Ansel’s jaw tightens as the thorn under his tongue fails to hum because the lie is too artful to prick at once. Kezra feels the thrill of a solved puzzle sing through the bones, even as the reeds click together like teeth. \", \"outcome\": \"The Drowned Queen’s Memory accepts the mask-name’s taste only to spit it back later, and when she does, shadows snap away from a handful of careless bargers and do not return until sunrise, leaving them weeping and stumbling as if half-remembered by themselves. The Accord can still be written, but it must be patched quickly to stop the harm, and its clauses are brittle, with contingencies upon contingencies because trust has been salted thin; Willowwife patience frays and some rites are withheld until amends are made. The relic-needle is recovered and returned under a cloud, with Prior Ansel insisting on extra oaths that taste of iron rather than peat, and Ossa warning that such flavors sour seed. Kezra gains the safe-passage token but finds it flickers in canals near the Floodwalk on moonless nights, a reminder that bargains dodged return as debts, and that ghost lights remember the shape of lying. In the aftermath, moth-supply stabilizes only after a second visit to the reeds with a truer offering, the Night Cartographers hint that they could sell a way to smooth the queen’s temper for a season, and Kezra’s reflection in still water shows a stranger’s eyes when tired.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Braid a Shared Name of Three\", \"text\": \"Kezra proposes a braid instead of a single strand, a name woven of three breaths with each consented and each witnessed: Willowwife, Order, and Oathbinder. Ossa steps forward first and speaks a name that tastes of roots and smoke and babies soothed when the water rose, and the reeds bow as if remembering the night her grandmother sang through a storm. Prior Ansel follows, reluctant but resolute, and offers a name he kept at war and in penance, one that cuts like a clean blade and means he will stand public scorn if the city breaks faith, and the thorn on his tongue flares and settles like a bell that has been answered. Kezra anchors the braid with the breath-name kept for water-bowls and lost maps, and together the three names float in the bowl like three moons, and the relic-needle’s point kisses their reflections without breaking them. The ghost lights circle in widening rings, and the straight water eases as if its shoulders have been rubbed by kind hands, because burdens shared weigh differently. \", \"outcome\": \"The queen smiles with the sound reeds make in a forgiving wind and accepts the braided name, agreeing to safe passage that does not ask for shadows so long as the braid is rewoven each Fogfast in a simple public rite where children blow reed-flutes and elders name those they aid. The Accord sets shared stewardship and forbids predatory terms by tying any levy to a triad’s consent, and it names a practice of reparations paid in peat work, seed exchange, and lantern-keeping rather than in raw coin alone, which proves harder to game and easier to honor. The relic-needle is returned beneath a willow canopy where Order and Willowwife wash it together, and it no longer hums with suspicion but with a low, satisfied note when liars approach, which both factions quietly appreciate for different reasons. Kezra receives a safe-passage token woven by Ossa’s own hands, and even the canal murk near the Floodwalk seems to move aside when it is shown, because the token remembers the children’s music. Over the next seasons the moth frames fatten, pilots whistle without fear on the straight cut, and though the Night Cartographers grieve the loss of an expensive fear, they quickly turn to selling maps of the new rite’s songs, which is a better business for everyone’s sleep.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M8\"], \"next\": [\"M10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Token\", \"description\": \"Safe-passage token woven of bone-white reeds that carries the queen’s forbearance, granting advantages in the Mourning Mire and on certain canal routes when shown at dusk-lit waters.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Relic\", \"description\": \"Relic-needle recovered from the peat-cache and entrusted for the final rite, its return witnessed under Willowwife rites and accepted by the Order without triumphal tax.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Alliance\", \"description\": \"Strengthened Willowwife relations that stabilize moth-supply and temper guild predation, opening paths for fairer trade between mire and city.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
