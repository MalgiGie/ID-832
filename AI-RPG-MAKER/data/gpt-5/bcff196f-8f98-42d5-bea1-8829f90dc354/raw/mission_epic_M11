Wind-bells crown the roof and ring in patterns that taste like arithmetic, each chime a note in a score of blame and promise, sugar and salt traded in the breath between rivals. Matron Selde presides in iron composure while Sera Verrin spreads a velvet of order over iron facts, proposing a charter that would saddle every upriver expedition with her house's harness and rein. Arelon Vale, river-born and oath-bound, extends his hand instead to a different discipline, asking for a public lantern that any citizen can read and a vow that no guild can hide behind, a compact braided from pilots, spindlers, and thistles black as a warning bloom. Beneath the polite clangor, the river outside runs low and mean, the reed-thing feeds where the fog is thinnest, and the city's patience stretches like a rope under load. In the rafters, a rumor moves like a moth's shadow as the Night Cartographers tug at a thread that should have been cut years ago, a small route sold by Kezra in a bad season that now threatens to become a map of shame. Lantern oil breathes rosemary and memory; oath-ink waits in its well; the city's hunger for a fair measure leans forward to hear what must be said and signed before the bells ring out of rhythm forever.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Convene the stakeholders and present the case for a public oath-chart held at the Lantern Archive.\",\n        \"Expose the counterfeit line’s method without humiliating the Exchange; propose safeguards that strengthen trust.\",\n        \"Confront the Night Cartographers’ leverage publicly before it festers; admit fault and close the thread.\",\n        \"Draft and secure signatures on the tri-fold compact between Pilots, Spindlewrights, and the Order; deny or amend Sera’s charter without making an enemy beyond repair.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Arelon Vale\", \"lines\": \"We can braid our strengths or we can each drown in a corner and pretend we were the last to breathe, and I have no appetite for private heroics that end in a public funeral. The river taught me that a rope is only as strong as its lay, and that lay is only honest when every strand is seen and served. Pilots know the bend, spindlers know the famine that follows silence in the looms, and the Order remembers what vows cost when we try to spend courage like coin. I will not put Thornspire to auction and bid my own oath against a house charter while the reeds whisper and the water drops out from under our feet. Kezra, set the pace with a lantern that does not flatter me, because if it shows my calluses along with everyone else's stains, then we will at least see what we are holding and who we are holding it for.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sera Verrin\", \"lines\": \"Order is not a sin, and neither is ambition, and I have never known a city saved by a chorus of apologies sung in a chapel without a ledger beside it. My charter is a promise of discipline and efficiency that trims waste and binds cost to outcome, and I offer it without cruelty, only with a clear eye for what famine does when a committee debates the price of a rope. Mercy does not require a procession if it arrives with full wagons, and I will not let poetry at the river's edge substitute for schedules and sealed crates. But I will not sign a compact that binds my house to rites that turn on a priest's mouth and a pilot's whistle while the Exchange begs forgiveness for last season's counterfeit fog.

The moths sing again, yes, but I remember the Moth Winter and how silence at the looms sounded like the first cough of a long sickness in a child's chest. I will sign your compact, Protector, if its first clause promises that no child spends winter without wool because a Factor wants to teach a lesson with scrip and a smile. We can hang your oath-chart where anyone can see it and thread in a clause that snaps shut when someone tries to trim weights with festival laughter. And if House Verrin wants to yoke its horses to our wagons, then let them feel the strain when the harness rubs, because I have no patience for sugar sprinkled on salt while fingers bleed at pedals.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Olan Vetch\", \"lines\": \"I will take vows on paper if they keep ropes out of my men's necks and stop cowards from buying pilots by the finger or by the whisper. When the demon's spine shifted last drought, a dozen crews leaned into the tow and I told them trust the whistle and the lantern because the water tells the truth if you let it. If I see one clause slipped in with a sweet courtesy that turns into a hook when the lights go down, I will whistle the Brotherhood out of the river and let the Hall count casks on dry land until their tongues crack. Bring me a chart that a ferryman's daughter can read without paying for a scribe and I will swear to guard it, even if it means I have to hear a priest test my mouth for thorns.

Secrets sold for life are still secrets sold, and I will not let a map of my shame steer this city now that the bells are ringing out of measure. We can draft the oath-chart here with everyone looking, we can hang it in the Lantern Archive where a lantern never goes dark once it is lit for a reader, and we can bind it to a bell that rings when someone tries to trim it or tuck a clause under a ribbon. Sera, bring your efficiency and your discipline, but do not ask them to sit on the scales with a thumb out while calling it balance. If we are to braid this rope, let every strand be named, measured, and sworn to in ink that sours when a liar breathes on it, and let my tongue bear another thorn if that is the price of a straighter line.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ansel Thornward\", \"lines\": \"Vows are not decorations for festivals, they are the stitches that keep a city's skin together when the water claws at the bone, and we do not cut stitches to show how strong we are. I have heard the reeds at midnight and the soft clatter of things that wear a man's shape to approach a door, and I tell you that we do not bargain with what watches from the shallows by promising profit. The Order will shoulder its share if this compact names the poor first and the powerful second, and if it binds charters to the same altar where we prick tongues and remember the day the river ran low. We will not taste coin, but we will weigh it by the grief it dodges, and if your lantern must burn over the oath-chart forever, then we will fast to keep its oil sweet.

If you must expose the method, do it in a way that teaches and repairs rather than delights the crowd with a villain and a flogging, because markets remember humiliation longer than they remember heroism. I will admit the bellweights ran light on festival days by a fraction we called kindness, and I will agree to fix them in public if the compact binds all parties to their own corrections. Let us try double signatures in chalk and oil, a singer from the looms to set the rhythm of seals, and a pilot's lead dipped in tallow on random lots to taste the truth of the bricks before they are stacked. Give me a safeguard that strengthens trust and I will open the vault so you can show the city how the honest bricks sound when struck by a clear hand.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lysa Quill\", \"lines\": \"I have drafted the first paragraph to read that the oath-chart shall be a public instrument lodged under the Lantern Archive's perpetual flame, cross-referenced by the Exchange's witness circle, and sung into memory by the Loom Cathedral on Fogfast. The second paragraph names the Pilots as stewards of current marks with a duty to revise under sworn notice, and it names the Order as auditors of intention with a duty to call a fast when greed oversteps measure. The third binds House Verrin's outfitting claims to emergencies declared by a triple bell of Protector, Hall, and Order, with a sunset clause at the next high river so that efficiency does not grow a throne. A fourth describes the counterfeit's method in sterile terms without a culprit, then prescribes safeguards of weight, song, and sample that any stallholder can verify without a learned scribe. If there are objections, I ask that we speak them here where the bells can record our breath, because sloppy law is the quickest sand known to any city that bargains with water.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Ring the bell of confession\", \"text\": \"Kezra stands within the sand circle until the bells hush, then speaks into the quiet with the steadiness that pilots use on bends where they cannot see the far shore. They describe the winter when a healer's bill outpaced mercy, and the small route sold in a back alley to a smiling broker with clean hands and a watchful shadow. There is no embellishment and no excuse, only the naming of the price and the naming of the regret that followed like a lantern that would not be doused. Kezra asks the Hall to let that thread end here, cut publicly, and offers a thorn on the tongue to bind the promise that no such sale will be made again under any pressure short of a life in the room. They then turn the confession into a bridge, asking all present to commit a fault of their own to the oath-chart as a first weight, so that the chart starts with truths that sting and not with boasts that float.\", \"outcome\": \"The Order stiffens and then nods as the thorn pricks and the taste of iron proves the vow, and Ansel publicly names the act forgiven when tied to a stronger promise. The Pilots murmur approval because a clear line is better than a pretty lie, and Olan offers his own admission about a wage argument lost in pride to match the weight. The Night Cartographers step back from their leverage because a thread cut in the open cannot be tugged in the dark, though their silent eyes promise they will watch for new threads to tie. Sera Verrin smiles that thin merchant's smile that says both respect and calculation, and while she does not praise the confession, she chooses not to weaponize it, banking the public's taste for courage as coin she can spend later. The bells record the confession as a clean tone, and the city's rumor mill carries the story as a hard truth rather than gossip, strengthening the ground for the tri-fold compact to be signed without whispers undermining every clause.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Weave the counterfeit into a parable with safeguards\", \"text\": \"Kezra lights the mnemonic lantern and sets a brick of honest salt beside a forged twin, inviting Selde and Brynna to strike each in turn while the lantern holds the sound like memory oil catches a face. In calm words, they describe how a line of ash-laced salt was made to ring right and weigh wrong, how the mold left a kiss mark that could be masked with a feathering of soot, and how a tired clerk's eye was nudged by festival lights that always feel a little like permission. No names are spoken and no fingers pointed, only the parable of a market that forgave itself too easily and thus became easy to trick. Kezra demonstrates three remedies in the same breath: bell-ink that blooms when touched by alkali out of measure, a Spindlewright's seal-hum that a brick must sing with, and a pilot's random tallow sample that brings grit truth to light. The crowd learns the tune of the honest ring and the shame of the false without being asked to jeer, and faces soften because repair is being taught rather than vengeance sold.\", \"outcome\": \"Selde Karst lifts her chin and agrees to adopt the safeguards with the Exchange's seal, and she offers to be the first to strike the new note each morning so clerks remember that they hear as well as see. Brynna binds a loom singer to the Exchange for a season so that weights and songs marry in public, turning verification into ritual that folk can attend and learn. The Salt Factors bristle but see the respect paid to the Exchange, and they accept the fix as a way to recover confidence without dragging their ledgers through the mud. House Verrin cannot attack the medicine without seeming to prefer the disease, and so Sera's argument narrows to efficiency rather than purity, which makes amending her charter easier later. Trust rises like a careful tide over the sand, and the compact's clauses on measures and witness pass with fewer cuts and less blood on the floor.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Amend the Verrin charter with emergency gate-clauses\", \"text\": \"Kezra holds Sera's parchment up to the lantern and reads it aloud as if it were a route in fog, naming the places where it runs straight and the shoals where a private keel would scrape public trust. They propose a gate of three bells that must be rung together before House Verrin can claim outfitter authority: the Protector's necessity, the Hall's solvency, and the Order's mercy, each bell a hand on a single rope. The authority is granted for emergencies only, sunsets at the next floodmark, and is recorded on the oath-chart so that any citizen can see when the harness tightens and when it must be loosed. Verrin wagons are welcomed to carry weight when the river runs thin or the moths fall silent, but every crate's seal is mirrored in the Archive, and any thumb on any scale will sour the ink and sing the bells. In exchange, the city accepts Sera's discipline where it serves all and not just the manse on the terrace, and Kezra names the compact as the table where this bargain eats and is watched.\", \"outcome\": \"Sera hesitates, calculates, and then nods with a courtly tilt because a bound authority is still authority, and public bells can be taught to ring when asked if the asking is honest. The Pilots relax because their routes remain public and their hands on the chart stay steady, and Olan signals that the Brotherhood will not boycott a house that has accepted visible checks on its reach. The Spindlewrights approve because a sunset clause keeps silk from being yoked forever, and Brynna remarks that harnesses do less harm when the skin they're on knows when it will be free. The Order signs the clause because it makes emergency power answer to mercy as well as measure, and Ansel adds a line that requires vows to be read aloud before any such authority is used. The charter survives in amended form, Sera earns a grudging courtesy rather than a bitter enemy's mask, and the city's factions step away from a brink where someone would have pushed too hard and fallen.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Table the charter and drive the tri-fold compact through\", \"text\": \"Kezra declares that no private charter, however well-gilded, can be weighed while the reed-thing takes mouths and the river writes new margins on old stones, and asks the Hall to table Sera's proposal until the next rise. They argue that the city needs a covenant first, a grammar of duty set by lantern, song, and oath, so that any future charter can be conjugated according to it rather than forcing the language to bend around a single house's speech. The urgency is made plain with ledgers of drowned seasons and dried ones, and with the whisper of the bells that remember a time when grain was measured between tears. Kezra looks Sera in the eye and promises to read her charter again in a season with the public chart above it and the city's needs written in the margins, which is a permission without a surrender. Then they call for signatures on the tri-fold compact where the ink is ready and the witnesses are present, and no one is allowed to leave the circle until they have either signed or spoken a reason that can bear light.\", \"outcome\": \"Arelon takes the lead and signs, and his signature draws others like a tow-rope drawing a reluctant barge through a slow bend until the compact has weight enough to sit. The Pilots add their marks and whistles sound in the rafters as a pledge, while the Spindlewrights sign with a thread knotted into the wax to make their promise visible to anyone with eyes. The Order's thorn pricks draw a small bead of red that is wiped on the chart's edge where it dries dark and honest, and the bells answer with a tone that steadies breathing. Sera accepts the tabling with a mouth that smiles and a hand that stops just short of clenching, and though her bravos will be cooler in the lanes for a time, the grudging pass is still extended because the insult was procedural and not personal. The city wakes the next morning with a compact to point at and no new feud put to fire, and the next debate over Sera's ambitions will happen under a lantern that shows every clause's seam.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C5\", \"title\": \"Invite the Night Cartographers into the light and bind them by measure\", \"text\": \"Kezra calls to the rafters where rumor sits and asks the Night Cartographers to step down if they would tug the old thread, because a map unrolled in shadow is a noose while one unrolled in light is a lesson. They recount the sale of the small route in plain language and lay the Glasslake shard on the sand to catch a reflection of the memory, then cut it carefully so that the room can see the glance without letting it breed a dozen false stories. Kezra offers a trade that is not coin but measure: the society may submit a shadow map to the Archive under seal that records changes in the demon's spine and sandbars at drought, and in return they will forsake any claim on private leverage born of personal ruin. The compact will name the Night Cartographers as witnesses to certain bends at midsummer noon when the Needle's shadow is said to cut a path, and their route-ink will be tested by the same bell-ink and song that the Exchange now accepts. The invitation is dangerous and generous, and it asks the society to choose between being priced by the ell in whispers and being weighed by the span before the city in the open air.\", \"outcome\": \"A figure with a hood stitched with compass roses steps down, measures the room with an eye, and agrees to the trade so long as their lens and their fingers are not confiscated in moments when the city would prefer convenient blindness. The Hall witnesses the agreement and Lysa writes it in a hand that cannot be mistaken, and the lantern holds the new thread as a line that can be audited rather than a snare that can be sprung. The society leaves with their dignity and their mystery, but their leverage over Kezra is broken because confession has already cut the line and the new accord gives them a path to profit without holding a knife behind their back. The Order sets a watch on the midsummer shadow with kinder eyes than before, because even secret-keepers who come when called are less likely to poison a well. The compact gains an unexpected strand that ties rumor to record, and the city's future arguments will have fewer ghosts and more maps to put on a table without anyone flinching.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M10\"], \"next\": [\"M12\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Document\", \"description\": \"Signed Compact of River and Loom, a formal backing for the final rite and a public covenant that binds Pilots, Spindlewrights, and the Order under lantern and bell.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Access writ to the Lantern Archive's oath-chamber at all hours, granting keys and lamp-rights to consult, amend, and witness the public oath-chart.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Pass\", \"description\": \"House Verrin grudging courtesy pass, reducing interference from Verrin bravos and smoothing checkpoints when business must cross their docks and doors.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
