In chambers cut from basalt and oath, the sound threads through galleries and stairwells until even the banners seem to quiver with unspoken meaning. Bellwright Dox mutters that chains only sing before great changes, and the Keep’s old hands have started to count the beats as if they were coins in a dwindling purse. The Oathstone in the central hall bears old cuts and a missing corner, and the grooves seem to sweat, salt fine as dust, when the chains strike a certain note that anyone who has known hunger can feel behind their teeth. Protector Arelon Vale summons Kezra Thorneglass to stand as neutral lantern-bearer between the Keep, the Hall of Shares, and the Order of the Black Thistle, and to read the song neither for profit nor for pride. The Protector wants the song read as a map that might steer a city through drought’s shoals, the Order wants it read as a warning that might bind the reckless to penance, and the guilds want it ignored until the Exchange bell closes and balance sheets sleep easy. Under the drip and the fading scent of rain on copper, rumor slicks the steps faster than moss, and every whisper rubs the city a little raw. Kezra must listen to the chains, trace their resonance through the Keep’s hidden sluice-veins, and learn whether the voice of metal is a chart of waters to come or a litany of vows strained thin. If the pattern is a river laid into sound, it can be sketched in lantern-light and carried to those who steer barges and budgets; if it is a reproach, it must be given to conscience before coin. Time shortens like a line tugged by a snag, and truth must be raised before tariffs and threats set like stones in a fast channel.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Protector Arelon Vale in Needle Keep and receive a sealed writ to act as neutral witness, accepting the burden of even-handed speech before guild and chapel alike.\",\n        \"Climb the inner galleries to listen to the rain-chains with Bellwright Dox and sketch their rhythm in lantern patterns, letting the cadence settle in ribs and teeth until a chart of sound emerges.\",\n        \"Consult Lantern-keeper Sula Reedmantle at the Lantern Archive about chain-song correspondences in flood years, comparing memory-oil records to the present descant without forcing the answer you prefer.\",\n        \"Examine the Oathstone grooves and note the salt-sweat; record hum intervals that match the chain’s song, and mark any harmonics that answer from the hidden sluice-veins.\",\n        \"Deliver a preliminary finding to the Protector and the Order without inflaming the Hall of Shares, choosing words that warn without accusing and guide without selling meaning by the ell.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Arelon Vale\", \"lines\": \"Kezra Thorneglass, your hands have steadied barges in water meaner than words, and I need that steadiness here where every syllable carries freight. I grew up under these chains and have heard them sing grief and plenty, but this is not the cadence of weather nor the idle chatter of copper. It runs like a ledger written in river-marks, and it nags as if an oath is being read badly and wants to be corrected. Read it for me, not to please me, the Hall, or the Order, but to lay the truth where all can see it and none can buy it alone. If it calls for ration and restraint, I will carry that into a hungry hall; if it calls for penance, I will bare my own faults first. If it is a drum for war, I would rather break the drum than march my folk into a price we cannot pay. Bring me a shape of the sound I can defend on the Keep steps, even when the wind of coin is in my face.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Bellwright Dox\", \"lines\": \"Hells below and the old sluice above, I have mended these chains in storm and siege, and I will swear this much even in a chapel’s shadow. Metal remembers the hands that hung it and the rain that loved it, and every drop is a finger on a harp-string that runs the length of the Keep. Stand close and breathe even, scribe-pilot, because the notes like to crawl up into your lungs and ring your teeth from the roots. This pattern is not the slapdash rattle of a summer squall; it is counted, and it leans heavy on every fifth like a wheel with a flat. I have heard something near to it once, when we burned peat to keep the counterweight furnace fed and the city starved on scrip. Mind your lantern and your heart, for if you let the sound set your pulse, you will start mistaking fear for prophecy.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sula Reedmantle\", \"lines\": \"Bring me your sketch of the cadence with the intervals you felt in your ribs, and do not be ashamed if you wrote the rests with your breath. There are old lamps whose oils were tuned to years of want and plenty, and their flames sway differently when spoken to by sounds they remember. I will not tell you that light knows more than water, but I will say that light remembers what water tries to carry off, and it can hold a shape long enough for a mind to step around it. Be wary, Kezra, because naming a sign aloud in a city of traders is to mint a coin, and coins always find pockets, not necessarily the right ones. If the song is a map, let us cut it carefully so it cannot be gelded and reminted by those who worship measures more than mercy. If it is a chastisement, carry it to those whose vows give them the right to scold, and keep your ink clear of accusations you cannot weigh in daylight.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Prior Ansel of the Black Thistle\", \"lines\": \"A chain that sings without rain is a tongue without a mask, and tongues without masks say what shame would hide. We hold this city by vows carved into stone and daily bread, and vows make noise when stretched like leather that has seen too many winters. If the note you hear is a call to penance, we must answer before any altar of profit, and I will carry the thorn myself if the fault is mine. If it is a call to war, we must refuse even if the drums are handsome and promise tidy accounts, for the river always collects interest in children. I ask no obedience from you, oath-bearer, only conscience and the courage to walk the Needle at dusk and let the sound choose your path. Bring me a truth that is costly, because cheap truths have been buying this city by inches for years.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kezra Thorneglass\", \"lines\": \"I will listen to the chains and not the rumors, and I will map what I can hear without trimming it to anyone’s ledger or fear. If the song is a road, I will lay it out in lantern-light so that old pilots and young factors can walk it together without shoving. If it is a warning, I will bind it to light so it cannot be sold by the ell nor bartered in smoke-filled rooms until its teeth fall out. I will take your writ, Protector, but I will keep my tongue-thorn between my words and any softening that would make them pleasing. Sula taught me that memory is a duty and not a toy, and my vow was to the city before any chair in its halls. I will carry the first thread of truth to you all before the Exchange bell closes, and I will stand in the doorway if need be to keep the sound from being taxed into silence.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Name the song a drought-ward vow\", \"text\": \"You propose that the chain-song is a measured drought warning, a summons to bind the city into a vow of ration and mutual relief before scarcity sets its claws. You describe how the fifth-beat weight matches the Archive’s storm-year lamps and the Oathstone’s salt-sweat, and you lay out a simple scheme to open the sluice-galleries for inspection while sharing non-proprietary route marks as a public trust. You insist that the Hall of Shares delay any tariff games until three river-soundings confirm the pattern, and you ask the Order to lead a public vigil that swallows pride as its first offering. You speak long enough that the hunger of fear cools, and you keep names off the fire so the room does not flare into blame. You emphasize that a city that rations early rations less, and that the cost of patience is cheaper than famine scrip and riot ash. You end by hanging your own lantern on the table and inviting any guild to copy the cadence freely, so long as they swear to teach it to their apprentices as a binding of care.\", \"outcome\": \"Arelon Vale seizes the chance to speak as steward rather than taskmaster, and his stock among pilots and common wards rises like a buoy in a clean current. The Order accepts the vigil and promises to eat humble bread with merchants in the square, which softens hard hearts that were braced for scolding. The Hall of Shares growls but agrees to three soundings and a tariff freeze, though Matron Selde whispers that those who pause first lose most, and her factors begin hoarding ash with quiet hands. Rumors cool into watchfulness rather than panic, and the Floodwalk starts marking doors with simple water-measure sigils copied from your lantern pattern. Finn Bracken brings word that some Night Cartographers are sniffing at the sluice-galleries, but the public oath makes it harder to sell maps in shadow for a high price. You gain calmer access to the Keep’s under-veins and earn a small measure of trust that will make stern rooms listen longer in the next council.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Name the song an oath-breach tied to false measures\", \"text\": \"You argue that the Oathstone’s salt-sweat and the chain’s counted cadence point toward a breach in the city’s measures, a false weighing that has leaked harm into every market and meal. You trace the interval that matches the Exchange bell stroke and lay a careful path from bellweight scandal to present scarcity, suggesting the city’s heart is ringing with the memory of a broken promise. You recommend an immediate audit under the Black Thistle’s witness, with the Lantern Archive holding custody of records, and you call for the Exchange to open its vault scales to public oil-light without naming any single guild a villain. You warn that delay will turn worry into opportunism and opportunism into famine scrip, and that the chain’s song will be remembered as the sound of people choosing coin over covenant. You petition the Protector to bind this as an even-handed decree and to put his own seal to the first weighed brick, so that the blame can claim no party and the remedy can claim all. You end by placing a thistle-prick of ink upon the table, a small ritual mark, and say that even the tongue that names must bleed a little to be believed.\", \"outcome\": \"The hall erupts like a kiln fed with pitch, and Matron Selde Karst’s smile sharpens to a knife that cuts without drawing blood, but she cannot easily refuse a citywide audit when you have not named her and when the Protector bares his own seal. Prior Ansel steps forward and makes a vow to hold the lantern that lights the first scale, and in doing so places the Order’s moral purse upon the table where the coins once clinked alone. Traders mutter that you have made a spectacle of faith, but small loom-houses and barge crews cheer a little in their throats, and the rumor of fairness walks quicker than any clerk. You earn fierce allies among those cut by counterfeit, and you make tidy enemies among those who profited in the fog, which is to say you make yourself visible in a city that prefers its knives friendly. The Exchange accepts the audit with the grace of a cat carried by the scruff, and you are given rare leave to stand within the sand-ring and watch chalk contracts drawn by trembling hands. In shadowed corners, the Night Cartographers begin measuring your steps with new interest, and an invitation written in ell and span is tucked under your door by morning.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Refuse to name the omen, and convene a river-vigil of proof\", \"text\": \"You decline to brand the song with any label sharper than pattern, and you propose a controlled vigil in which proof is courted with humility and method instead of dragged in with shouting. You outline three nights of tests, pairing chain-cadence with sluice-valve harmonics and Archive lamp-flickers, and you promise to publish the raw notes openly so no faction can abridge the truth. You ask the Protector to keep the watch gentle and the gates open, the Order to keep the prayers soft and the judgments slower than fear, and the Hall to bind their hands from tariff play until the third dawn. You note that a city that panics at whispers has forgotten how to listen, and you say that patience is also an oath, a binding of time to courtesy. You place your sounding lead on the table and say the river remembers those who test it with care, and that a steady hand can learn more than a clever argument when copper starts to sing. You propose that if the third dawn yields no consensus, you will name your conclusion at noon on the Needle steps and accept all stones and all thanks in the same bowl.\", \"outcome\": \"The room breathes again, and the decision not to decide feels, for a delicate hour, like courage rather than fear, which is a rare thing in a hall of measures. Arelon Vale agrees to the vigil and orders the bells to mark the three nights with a soft pattern that matches your lantern sketch, and the Order posts brothers with thistle-wreathed spears to keep watch without sermons. The Hall of Shares chafes but accepts the restraint, and a few factors even admit that a public notebook makes it harder to sell panic disguised as prudence. The Floodwalk sleeps easier, because tests feel like work and work quiets the teeth, and small wards begin humming the cadence as if to teach their own walls to listen. In the third night, you catch a faint answering hum from the sluice-veins that complicates every easy story, and Sula’s lamp remembers a storm-year that did not flood, only tightened belts. The Night Cartographers try to buy your raw notes with a mirror of the city none can find twice, but your refusal becomes its own small lantern, and strangers begin to nod to you in stairwells where they once watched you pass without a word.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"\"], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Writ\", \"description\": \"Sealed Writ of Neutral Witness from the Protector, bearing the needle-and-river seal and granting access to civic hearings, guarded spaces, and council rooms where decisions are hammered while tempers glow.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Leave to traverse the Needle Keep’s sluice-galleries for future work, including bell-chain gantries and cold-forge passages, with a bell-token that hushes warders and unlocks iron grates.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"A vial of memory oil from Lantern-keeper Sula tuned to storm-years, whose scent steadies the hand and clarifies recorded patterns when light wants to wander.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
