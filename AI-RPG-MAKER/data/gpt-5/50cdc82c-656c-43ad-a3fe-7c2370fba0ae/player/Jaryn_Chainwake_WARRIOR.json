    "race": "Human (Riverfolk)",
    "appearance": {
        "description": "Broad-shouldered riverborn with sun-browned skin and storm-black hair tied in a pilot’s knot. Wears layered leather with emberglass scale plates, a weathered river-cloak, and a rope-belt strung with tool-hooks.",
        "distinctive_signs": "A prismed scar across the left cheek from a Shard-shed splinter; a tattoo of interlocked chains and waves on the right forearm signifying a vow to keep crossings open."

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Jaryn Chainwake grew in Murkwall’s flood-stooped lanes, the Shard’s dusk-breath his nightlight and the Luthien his schooling. As a teen he hauled lines in Chainward, learned crane-sign, and stood as a hook guard on barge convoys when toll feuds ran hot. The Pilots’ Covenant took him on as a shieldman during spring surges, where he earned his surname hauling a snapped toll-chain clear in a flood. He later rotated to union watchlines at the House of Reconciliation, helping keep tempers from becoming torches when heat-levy caps were fought. He respects the Order of the Shard’s wardens but bristles at rites that halt work on hungry days. He has ferried scholars of the Asterion Collegium to measure the Shard’s song, and once escorted a night-sap run near the Moonless Orchard where he tasted the fruit and forgot who first taught him to splice a rope. Jaryn avoids House Kelvar debt ledgers, having watched friends drown in numbers. He keeps the river’s codes, can hear when the Shard hums louder before a storm, and carries both blade and barge-hook with the practiced calm of a crane crew chief. With rumors of convoys being trimmed by unseen hands, he has begun to gather a small band willing to guard routes that guild charters neglect.",

    "secrets": "Years ago he ran a quiet courier job for Tala that masked a Night Orchard exchange beneath the Chainbridge; his parcel was a decoy that let others lift a ring of keys tied to a hidden lock under the span. He has never told Mara, and Neris suspects the theft relates to the council cavity inside the Shard’s collar."
