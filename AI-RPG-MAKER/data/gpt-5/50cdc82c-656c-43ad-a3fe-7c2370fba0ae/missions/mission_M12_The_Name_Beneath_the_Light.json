    "description": "Inside the Shard, a sealed stair descends into cold blue, steps that shine as if lit from under water. The air smells like rain caught in stone. Your hands carry what the journey gathered: a bell’s tongue that answered from peat, a ring-chord that remembers a moon, a mnemonic spring from a machine that still knows work, and resin-lacquer that teaches light to hold without pulling. Lysa walks beside you with a jaw set like an oath; Neris and Jaya steady the harmonizer; Mara and Tala keep the line taut above. Shadows move on the stair like pieces of your own delay, and halfway down the Gardener’s splinter waits with Thane Kelvar’s last gambit: quiet the Shard for seven breaths and prove the city will beg for paid light. They speak to the part of you that wants storms to end by any means. The lower chamber hums like a throat clearing. The name the city has been trying to say sits just beyond your hearing.",

        "Descend the sealed stair within the Shard Bastion with your assembled team.",

        "Seat the fen bell’s tongue as a ground for the chord and apply resin-lacquer to the ward panes.",
        "Confront the Gardener’s splinter and Thane Kelvar and prevent the seven-breath quieting.",
        "Stabilize the Shard’s hum and return safely to the surface."

Let the city sleep and wake to a paid dawn where no one cries because the light failed without a ledger to blame. Mercy often looks like steel when it is done correctly."

Hear the rings sing rain over your figures. Hear the machines remember their promise. Then either help us hold the note or get out of the stair and live with the sound of a name that isn’t yours being saved."
