    "description": "At dusk, the Luthien wears a scarf of mist and the Chainbridge hums a faint counter-song to the Shard. Barges crowd the River Market under chain-strung awnings, and word runs along the decks that the Chanting Ford sang a sour note at dawn. Mara Tidecall, your old captain, has pulled together a dusk convoy of grain and glass to push upriver before House Kelvar’s toll chains ratchet tighter at midnight. The Pilots’ Covenant fears reedcutters gone bandit and a pattern of near-silent ambushes that leave only cut ropes and a feeling of having been watched. Mara wants you as hard shield and listening ear: escort the convoy, hear the Ford, and tell her whether the river is singing names you recognize or the kind of wrong that ends in candle floats at Riverwake.",

Tonight it tasted like copper, and the names ran together like bad ink. I don’t trust a current that hides its voice. Get up there, keep the barges shouldered tight, and tell me if the river’s gone shy or if someone’s stuffed wax in her teeth."

I’ll listen and I’ll keep the hooks ready, but if Kelvar’s boys tighten the tolls while we’re midstream, I’ll be the one to cut their chain free before anyone drowns in numbers or steel. We’ll bring your grain into safe water."

I’ll have the flood-bell ready at your call, chief. It’s an ugly song when debt writes the chorus, but no one drowns on my watch if I can help it."
