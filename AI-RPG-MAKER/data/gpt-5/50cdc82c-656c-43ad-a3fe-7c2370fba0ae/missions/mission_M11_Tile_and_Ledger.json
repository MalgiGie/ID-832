    "description": "The Shard Bastion throws blue breath over Chainward as Lysa Shardhands invites you into a warded chamber where words are meant to line up like soldiers. She has heard enough to doubt her own command, and your palimpsest copy pricks her like a thorn under her nail. She proposes a bargain: present the evidence before Preceptor Vara Lume and secure a sanction to sound the sealed stair if needed. In return, the Order will shelter your crew against Kelvar reprisal. But to steel the case you must pull a knot from the House Kelvar Counting Hall: a ledger bead-string that tallies private glow contracts to toll-clan cousins. Sava Inkweft can map a tunnel hatch beneath the court dais to get you out if the tide turns. You will walk into numbers that have teeth and try to come out with a string that tames them.",

If she does not, I will carry that shame with her until it breaks, but I will not pretend I do not see the crack forming."

Do not be brave when you should be quick. Take only what you must, and do not let the tide-clock mark you with its shadow."

But if I walk that sealed stair for you, I walk it for the river too. We settle the hum so children sleep and barges pass, not to make anyone’s sigil shine brighter."
