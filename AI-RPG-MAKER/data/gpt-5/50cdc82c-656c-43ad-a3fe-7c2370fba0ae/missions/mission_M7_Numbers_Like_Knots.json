    "description": "Under Mirrorclose, the Silent Archive keeps river-rights and guild oaths in clay tubes and lime-washed galleries where footsteps seem to walk away from you. Sava Inkweft, ink-stained and steady, meets you beneath whispering lamps. She says a palimpsest has surfaced that names who first took the Night Orchard’s oath and who keeps a third ledger written in beads, not ink. That palimpsest also sketches a ladder into a Shard collar cavity where councils meet without law, and a schedule of when tide-clocks call debts at the Counting Hall. House Kelvar wants the page drowned in saltwater. The Order wants it sealed under a ward no one can speak through. Sava wants it copied, not stolen; she wants truth that can stand in a hall without knives. Downstairs, the seep whispers like a child practicing names. You have learned to move quiet in places where sound is not welcome.",

This palimpsest is not a sword to cut throats with; it’s a mirror to make proud faces blink. Copy it clean, fold it into your belt, and put it somewhere it will be heard by those who can do more than shout. I ask you because you have carried both secrets and soup."
