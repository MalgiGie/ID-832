    "description": "Night peels down the Chainbridge as if it were a fruit, and the pivoting panel opens on a ladder into a cavity where the river’s breath turns to a low blue fog. Joints of iron and prisms of shed crystal hold a room that has heard vows without witnesses and decisions without records. The palimpsest’s timing was true; Thane Kelvar stands there like a tide-clock with a smile, and opposite him a stern warden in Order blue whose name Lysa refuses to speak. A masked voice speaks from the fog, cut with sap-sweetness that smells of orchards; the Gardener’s splinter, or a careful echo. Their plan breathes like a forge: provoke a hum-falter, snap a few supply chains, sell a private glow while the city begs, leverage debt to bind guilds, and shush the Shard with a quieting chord. You cannot fight iron beams and fog with a barge-hook alone. You must listen, take words like evidence, and leave with your skin and the city’s chances intact.",

The Shard is a public fountain that encourages waste. A little quiet will teach a generation the value of paid light and properly timed heat. Our ledgers will sing, and the city will thank us for our discipline."

We will ask the city to sit still and breathe. Those who thrash will be tied down with silken cord until they tire of their own noise. It is a kindness, of a sort."
