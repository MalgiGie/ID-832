    "description": "Southwest, the Shiverfen Reedmarch breathes as the wind pushes slow blackwater between reed catenaries. Tala Fenmint greets you with mint on her breath and peat on her boots, but her smile drifts when she speaks of a muffled chime under the peat. Riverfolk have argued for years about a sunken bell from a temple that never was, and the Order funds bell-hunters who never find more than silt. But when the Shard sang hard last dusk, a second, buried note answered and spooked herons from their snags. Tala wants you on her boat and your hook on her lines while she lifts the bell’s tongue from sucking mud and lamp-eel glare. The fen wives love vowbreakers and forgetful men; the reeds will take your ankles like debts take wages. You know the smell of fever winds, and you know when to whisper quiet and when to strike loud.",

I don’t chase omens if I can help it, but I won’t leave a bell under mud when the city’s forgetting its own names. Bring your hook and your patience. The fen remembers every footstep, and it trades fairly only with those who listen."

And if a fenwife shapes herself out of fog to look like a kindness I forgot, I’ll tie myself to the mast and let your curses keep me honest."
