    "description": "On a misted night when lanterns blur into stars, Iven Shadequinch steps out of a fog bank beneath the Chainbridge. He is a gardener who never carries dirt under his nails, and he remembers your old guilt though he never speaks it aloud. He says keys were cut for a lock no one admits exists, and that someone will reach for them tonight with a hand dipped in debt and doctrine. He needs you to move a decoy ring through the pivoting panel at mid-span, draw eyes and blades, and buy the Orchard time to plant a counter. The panel hides a ladder into a collar cavity big enough for a council meeting, and the lock below that cavity hears old metal sing. House Kelvar’s guards watch the toll towers, the Order has posted a warden in a fury of piety, and Garrin Chainwatch runs the mid-span like a stubborn helmsman. This is a dance on a chain with truth below it like cold black water.",

There is a lock here older than the charters and hungrier than the tolls, and fools with tidy ledgers want to turn it to shut out voices they don’t like. Carry my decoy where it will be seen, let their greed chase shadows, and I will put the true teeth where they belong. I do this for the city’s canopy, not for coin."

I’ve seen smugglers crawl under this deck like beetles and I’ve seen lovers whisper promises that walked along the links to strangers. Give me a straight word, Jaryn. If you lie, I’ll know by the way your hand sits on your hook."

If I let the wrong people set their teeth in the right key, we’ll wake to find half the city sold to a ledger number. Stand with me or stand aside, but don’t call a flood down on us while we’re still crossing."
