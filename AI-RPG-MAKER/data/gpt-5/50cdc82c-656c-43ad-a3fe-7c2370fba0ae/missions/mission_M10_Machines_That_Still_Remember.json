    "description": "South, the Clockwork Ruins of Virdane grind gently when the wind sighs, as if the ground chews old cogs like cud. Borgo Emberdell wears furnace heat like a cloak and these ruins like a childhood. He needs a mnemonic spring—an old memory-coil—that can hold the ring-chord steady inside a harmonizer so it doesn’t wander and draw sleepers like a tide. The corridors here listen for command-words and obey in their own time; the wrong word wakes guardians that look like crabs sculpted from astrolabes. Fungal spores curl time around your eyes so a minute feels like a winter and a winter feels like a breath. Rook Salter volunteers to keep the rope taut at your waist so the ruin doesn’t forget your outline.",

I need a spring that still knows what it was made for. Bring me that, and I’ll build you a heart that won’t skip when the city needs it steady."

If a guardian wakes, I’ll ask it to remember patience before I ask it to remember pain. We get the spring, we keep our feet, and we go home with all our names in the right order."
