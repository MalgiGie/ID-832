    "city": "Cyrasha, called the River-Shard City, rises from twin banks of the broad Luthien River where a star-glass monolith—known simply as the Shard—pierces the current like a frozen lightning bolt. The city was founded three centuries ago by riverfolk and refugees after the Nightfall War, when the Shard first rose from the riverbed, flensing the fog and drawing lights from the sky. Its earliest quarter grew around chain-anchored platforms bolted to the Shard’s flanks, and the low banks quickly terraced into districts that cling like lichen to stone. Today, glittering causeways and chainbridges tie the two shores to the central monolith, while barge-rafts, cable-ferries, and crane-towers shuttle people and freight between water, quay, and crystal. Cyrasha’s skyline is a riot of lanterns and prismed glow, for the Shard drinks sunlight and exhales a cool luminescence each dusk, feeding glass-lamps along streets lined with mixed wood-and-stone houses capped by stormweight tiles. The economy turns on three pillars: crystalwork carved from the Shard’s shedding plates, river trade that stitches the inland agraries to coastward city-states, and emberglass metallurgy that marries volcanic sand to Shard-light. Governance is a knot of guild charters, river laws, and temple edicts. A nominal lord-mayor, chosen by the Twelve Seals of Charter, presides over a council crowded by faction spokes. The Order of the Shard enforces sacred prohibitions on defacing the monolith, though the Crystalcutters Guild holds a charter to harvest its shed plates and slough fines. The Asterion Collegium studies the Shard’s aetheric harmonics, claiming the monolith hums to a lunar cadence; riverfolk swear they can hear the song on fog-thick nights. Neighbor districts specialize: Chainward is cranes, hooks, and ropewalks; Emberbank is furnaces and foundries; Mirrorclose is artisans and stained-glass guildhalls; Lanternstep is scholars’ courts and scroll-vendors; and Murkwall is the old ward of flood-stooped houses and leaf-thick lanes where rumors grow faster than ivy. Legends say the Shard is a pinned star—others call it the tooth of a sleeping god. During the Storm of Unmoored Lights, year 271, luminous fish rained over the river and hatched in cisterns; the Order declared them omen-kin and banned their sale, yet they still appear now and then in market buckets, traded under a finger-tap code. The city’s prosperity depends on barge convoys that must pass reed-haunted fens and toll towers, on quarry stone from hill-cutters upriver, and on emberglass sand from westward dunes. Faction rivalries simmer: the Pilots’ Covenant and House Kelvar, a merchant clan, duel via tariffs; the Hearth Union of workers demands heat-levies be capped in winter; and the Night Orchard—whispered to prune problems from the city’s canopy—sells rumors more deftly than blades. Cyrasha’s festivals pivot around light: at Duskfast, children hang mirrors in doorways to ‘feed the Shard’; at Riverwake, lanterns are set upon bread-rafts for the drowned. If the Shard’s hum ever faltered, the city would dim and its fragile alliances likely fracture into open water-wars. Yet for now, the river runs friendly, the night glows blue, and Cyrasha’s name is written in trade-ledgers from salt-coast to high pass.",
