Barge decks creak beneath grain sacks and emberglass crates bound for upstream kitchens and chimneys, and the Chainbridge Crown’s iron flanks carry a faint shiver like a plucked string. Word has run ahead like ripples before a keel: at dawn the Chanting Ford sang a sour throat-note, a name mispronounced by the water itself, and old hands spat over the gunwales for luck. House Kelvar’s toll chains will ratchet tighter by midnight, and the Pilots’ Covenant won’t let their people be squeezed dry between numbers and night. Your old captain, Mara Tidecall, has called you in not only to be a hard shield, but an honest ear to what the river names; the Covenant whispers of reedcutters turned toll-bandits, of near-silent ambushes in the reedmists that leave only cut ropes and a lingering feeling of being watched from water-level eyes. You will ride the dusk convoy into the Ford’s wide mouth where slate teeth sing a choral braid, keep towlines clean of snags and opportunists, and listen, really listen, for whether the Luthien still speaks true. If the song is wrong, you must decide what chord to strike in answer—bell, word, or blade—so that Riverwake’s candles need not multiply by dawn. The Shard hums a little harder when storms think of coming, and tonight, under its glass-blue promise, the river waits to be read like a ledger written in foam and tone.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Report to Mara Tidecall at the Pilots’ House by the Chainbridge Piers.\",\n        \"Escort the dusk convoy through the Chanting Ford and keep towlines clear.\",\n        \"Drive off toll-bandits masquerading as reedcutters without escalating to blood-feud.\",\n        \"Listen for changes in the Ford's overlapping tones and record them with your prism-lamp code.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Tidecall\", \"lines\": \"You’ve always had an ear for the Ford, Jaryn, and I trust it more than I trust any tide-clock nailed to a counting-hall wall. The river names us when we cross her teeth, and today she slurred like a drunk scribe and tasted of copper, and that is a taste I only like when it’s on the bell’s tongue. House Kelvar’s chains will cinch at midnight, and the bandit-reedcutters know it; they slip like fog and leave cut towlines coiled like dead eels, and they think that if they keep to soft hands they can claim they never meant blood. I need more than strong arms; I need the truth of what the water says, because a wrong note there can mean a wrong city here, and I have seen too many winters where one bad crossing wrote a whole season of hunger. Go up with the dusk convoy, shoulder the barges tight as kin, keep my people from foolish rushes, and listen for the names; if the river has wax in her teeth, I want to know who put it there and why. And Jaryn—if you must raise a bell or a blade, do it with the kind of care that remembers we have to live with these banks tomorrow; drive off what needs driving but don’t plant a feud that will sprout swords in spring.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaryn Chainwake\", \"lines\": \"I remember how the Ford sang my first river-right, and how you cuffed my ear when I tried to force a flood to hurry, Captain. The Chainbridge planks ticked under my boots at dawn like a warning hand, and the Shard’s hum came up through the iron like rain on bronze; there’s weather in this, but weather does not smear names unless a hand smears them. I will keep the towlines clean, the barges tight, and the crew’s temper cooler than kiln-brick after midnight, and I will cut no chain unless drowning is already on the ledger. If Kelvar’s factors pull tricks midstream, I will put the river’s rights in my voice before I put steel in my hand, and if reedcutters come with masks and soft-voiced knives, I will talk first, shove second, and only slice last. I’ll record every change in tone with the prism-lamp codes and bring back a strand of the Ford’s song you can hold in your palm like a kept promise.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rook Salter\", \"lines\": \"Chief, I’ve loaded the flood-bell and greased the tongue so she won’t stick to her own spit when we need her to ring true, and I’ve chalked the tow-hooks where a cold hand might fumble. Folks say the reedcutters turned tollmen feel for ropes in the mist like blind carp, but their knives are sharp in all the places the law’s dull, and I don’t intend to give them a taught line to cut. I’ve drilled the crew on finger-tap code for silent calls, and I’ve put a quiet lad on each stern to watch the river’s skin for those little dimples that mean someone’s waiting at water-level with breath held. The sour note at dawn put a beetle under everyone’s collar; you can hear it in the way the deckboards complain under footfall, and fear spreads faster than lamp-oil if someone knocks the can. Still, I’ve seen you set a line true in worse company than fog and whispers, and I swear by the bell and the bread-rafts of Riverwake that no one goes under while I’ve a voice to shout and hands to pull.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tala Fenmint\", \"lines\": \"Riverfriend, the reedmarch smells different when fear runs through it; the mint goes bitter and the gnats show you your own reflection in their glass eyes if you look too long. I walked the blind creeks at noon and found fresh cuts on guide-poles that weren’t made by Pilots’ knives, and I heard lamp-eels hiss like wet saws at a place where peat gives underfoot without a ripple. The bandits wearing reedcutter hats have a soft-footed pride; they do not want blood on their hands, but they will take rope, and rope is breath to a convoy if you fog your own. There’s a mint-channel I can whisper you through if you choose the quieter way; it runs behind a wax-bark copse where fenwives are said to pluck vows like fruit, and if you keep a promise in your mouth you can’t be led by theirs. Keep your lamp low, count the names, and if the Ford sings wrong again, remember that a wrong song sometimes comes from a throat choked by someone else’s hand; free the choke and the voice comes back.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"M1-C1\", \"title\": \"Ring the flood-bells early and loud\", \"text\": \"You order the flood-bells tested in full voice at the Chainbridge Piers and again as the convoy noses into the first shallows, a warning to any hand that thinks mist can make a mask of law. You stand high on a crate of grain and shout the river-rights for all to hear, a litany of names and crossings that even the fog must respect, and you let House Kelvar’s watchers across the way know you do not intend to be quietly trimmed. The crew breathes easier as the tones braid with the river’s own harmonies, and you see shoulders drop as if a weight has slid back into the water where it belongs. Rook’s bell rings true, and the sound turns the dark into a place where errors must name themselves before they move, and that makes ghosts and men alike think twice. You know it risks spooking honest reedcutters and can draw the attention of anyone itching for a loud excuse, but a bold chord now might clear the waterway of hands that prefer the soft theft that breeds feuds later.\", \"outcome\": \"The early peals ripple down the Ford like bright stones across a drum and scatter a pair of masked cutters who melt back into the reeds, deciding this won’t be a quiet pluck; a length of towline later turns up nicked but unsevered, proof that a blade hesitated. House Kelvar’s toll-tower clerk appears on a balcony with a ledger and a squint, but he closes the book when the bell names the Covenant’s right of passage at dusk under flood-watch, and his guards lean their spears where the iron learns to nap. The convoy passes the first teeth without a snag, and the crew’s finger-tap chatter settles into workman rhythm, though one echo in the bell’s fade carries a strange dissonance that your prism-lamp catches as an off-beat code. Mara’s trust in you deepens when your report reaches her, and she notes that sometimes loud mercy prevents loud war, but she warns the bell costs goodwill with those who think you peacocked on the river’s stage. Your choice wins space and time, and yet a distant, softer bell answers from somewhere behind the reeds, as if someone has learned your chord and intends to test your ear for it again.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M1-C2\", \"title\": \"Parley with the masked reedcutters at oar’s length\", \"text\": \"You call for oars and slack, bring the barges to a cautious drift, and raise your empty hands so lantern-light fills your palms instead of steel, showing that you mean to trade words before blows. You ask the river for silence and get it, a hush like a held breath across slate teeth, and in that space you invite the masked cutters to step into the lamp’s ring and name their price and grievance. You speak the old river customs—that no rope should be cut on a bread-barge, that grain runs first in lean months, that a mistaken hand can make amends with labor instead of blood—and you offer a rite-offering of work-ropes and fresh hooks rather than coin that would be read as toll. You let them see the Pilots’ seal on your copper ward-tile, not as a threat but as a reminder that law and water both bend when spoken to carefully, and that you, too, have cut peat and paid with blisters. Behind your words is your stance, the set of your feet like anchors in the deck, and the way your crew watches you with trust that can’t be counterfeited; your parley is a plank you lay between boats so no one falls in.\", \"outcome\": \"Two figures rise from the reed-curtain with knives held low and palms open to your lamp, and their leader admits their quarrel is with Kelvar ledgers that turned wages into knots, not with the Covenant’s grain; he agrees that rope cut tonight makes children hungry tomorrow. They ask for three coils and four hooks and the promise that you carry word upriver that the reed-cut camps need fair weights on their tally-stones, and in return they point out a snag-shelf that would have taken your stern line in the next reach. Your crew mutters but obeys, and when the masked folk melt away, the towlines hold, the barges clear the shelf by a handspan, and no one bleeds or drowns or learns a taste for it. Rook reports later that someone followed at a respectful distance with a slow paddle, and your prism-lamp notes a new hesitation in the Ford’s chorus, as if the river itself recorded the bargain. Mara receives your account with a smile lines can’t hide; she marks that you drove off harm without baiting a blood-feud, and the Covenant names you for a negotiator who can keep crossings open when numbers and knives try to close them.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M1-C3\", \"title\": \"Slip the convoy through Tala’s mint-channel in quiet formation\", \"text\": \"You signal the barges to damp their lamps to quarters and take Tala’s reed-murmured path, a back-breath of the river that smells of crushed mint and damp wax-bark, the kind of scent that maps itself more honestly than ink. Lines go slack enough to breathe but not enough to wander, and you walk the gunwales like a metronome, measuring each step against the hush of the channel’s skin, listening for the Ford’s chorus like a bird listens for rain. A shadow fox watches from a slicked trunk and then turns away, tail writing a bracket in the dark, and you take that as permission but not blessing; superstition is a handrail, not a law. You hold your prism-lamp down at belt height and tick codes into your thigh where only those who need the message feel it, and you keep a promise in your mouth as Tala advised, an old oath about keeping crossings open that tastes of salt and smoke. Where suction peat breathes under a mat, you spread weight like a lesson across the planks, and in places where the night wants to make you forget the kindness owed, you rehearse names under your breath until memory holds fast like a good knot.\", \"outcome\": \"The convoy ghosts the worst of the Ford’s teeth, bypassing a place where a line of cut cork floats like a trapper’s smile, and the only sounds are the drip of slow water and the soft remorse of boots on wet wood. A snag rises like a remembered mistake but passes beneath without taking more than a thread of hemp, and even the lamp-eels, hungry for light, are starved by your dim discipline. On the far side of the mint-channel, the river’s main throat opens again, and the tones come back clearer for a few long breaths, enough for your prism-lamp to record a pattern that suggests an imposed dissonance rather than a natural one. A shape in the reeds keeps pace for twenty heartbeats and then stops dead, as if a listening post had decided it had heard enough, and Rook swears he saw a flash of beadwork like Kelvar guard-livery on a wrist, which is its own question to carry to Mara. You emerge with every sack and pane intact, no blood fed to the river, and a story that the Covenant can use to chart a safer dusk lane without lighting a fire that others must spend a winter putting out.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Pilots’ Covenant reputation (modest increase): word spreads along the piers that you kept rope, grain, and tempers intact while reading the river true.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Knowledge\", \"description\": \"Updated prism-lamp convoy codes for fog signaling: a refreshed braid of pulses and shutters tailored to the Ford’s current harmonics and dusk-traffic habits.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Currency\", \"description\": \"A pouch of river coin for hazard pay: honest silver and copper stamped with tide-marks, enough to oil crew palms and mend a hook or two.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
