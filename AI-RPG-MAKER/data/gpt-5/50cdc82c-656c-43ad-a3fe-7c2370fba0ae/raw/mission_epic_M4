"{\n  \"missions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"M4\",\n      \"title\": \"The Fen’s Answering Bell\",\n      \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Tala Fenmint\", \"affiliation\": \"Shiverfen guide\"},\n      \"description\": \"Southwest of Cyrasha, where the Luthien slackens into blackwater and the wind presses thin ripples through reed catenaries, the Shiverfen Reedmarch exhales a breath that smells of mint, peat, and forgotten oaths. Chainbridges fall behind and the Shard’s dusk-glow thins to a blue smear in mist, but its song still finds you along the channels, a low bronze hum that rides the bones more than the ear. Riverfolk speak of a bell swallowed by peat from a temple that never stood, and of nights when that buried bronze answers the Shard like a muffled name trying to be remembered. When last dusk’s chorus rose bright, herons spooked from their snag perches and a second note rolled under the mats of floating earth, slow as a heartbeat and twice as stubborn. Tala Fenmint is there with mint on her breath, peat on her boots, and a boat that sits shallow and quiet; she asks you to bring your barge-hook and your patience, to keep lines tight while she coaxes a bell’s tongue from mud that clings like debt and from lamp-eels that bite light. The Asterion Tuning Pin—a sliver of calibrated alloy wound with hair-thin glass—rests in a leather tube, its tip meant to tremble when the right harmonic brushes past, and you are to listen for its shiver and steer. The fen has its wives who stir fog into familiar shapes and its reedcutters who moonlight as toll-bandits, and the peat underfoot pulls ankles the way numbers pull wages; the lamp-eels blink black sparks whenever a lantern falters. Your work is simple only on paper: travel with Tala, find the right blackwater pocket by tone, lift the bell’s tongue intact with its script unscarred, and return to the river proper without feeding the fen stories a new name. You have hauled lines in worse weather, you have watched councils wrap chains around simple crossings, and you know how to whisper when the water listens and when to strike loud so that men with hidden knives remember they, too, can fall into the dark.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\"Travel with Tala Fenmint to the Shiverfen Reedmarch by barge.\", \"Locate the site of the supposed sunken bell using the Asterion Tuning Pin.\", \"Recover the bell's tongue and any inscriptions without breaking the relic.\", \"Evade lamp-eels and reedcutters moonlighting as toll-bandits on the return.\"],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tala Fenmint\", \"lines\": \"When the Shard called last night, something under the peat answered like a throat that hasn’t spoken in years, and it pulled at the hair on my arms the way fever winds do. I don’t chase omens if I can help it, but I won’t leave a bell under mud when the city’s forgetting its own names, not when the fen itself hums as if reminding us what we owe. Bring your hook and your patience and leave your hurry in the city, because haste breaks more than it saves out here. The fen remembers every footstep and every lie, and it trades fairly only with those who listen longer than they speak. If we hear that second note again, we move like reeds in a kind wind: together, bending, and without pride that snaps in the shallows.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaryn Chainwake\", \"lines\": \"I’ve heard the Ford stumble and the Chainbridge tremble, and I’ve stood on decks that sang louder than fear, but I’ve never heard a note pull birds from their roosts like a net pulls fish. If there’s a second name ringing under the fen, I want to hear it clean and carry it back without scratching its letters. I’ll keep the lines and you keep the course, and I’ll mind the Pin like a helmsman minds flood-bells in a rising storm. If a fenwife shapes herself out of fog to look like a kindness I forgot, I’ll tie myself to the mast, shut the lamp, and let your curses keep me honest until the trick passes. The river taught me to square my shoulders, but it also taught me that sometimes you duck and drift because the current isn’t yours to fight head-on.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tala Fenmint\", \"lines\": \"You still owe me a story and a mint, and the fen knows that kind of debt like a cousin knows your walk. If a shadow asks for both, give her neither, because bargains made on a fogged breath buy you nothing but more fog. And if the bell doesn’t want to come, don’t tear it loose like a debt-collector with a ledger and a cudgel, because bronze that resists remembers the hands that forced it. We coax, we don’t conquer; we set slings and we lift on the exhale; we praise the mud even as we ask it to let go. Even the mud here has a memory, and it will take ours if we make it angry with iron.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neris Aline\", \"lines\": \"This is the Asterion Tuning Pin, tuned to a subharmonic we charted when the Shard’s song wavered during a mist surge, and it will prickle in your fingers when you drift over the right resonance. Hold it between finger and thumb with your wrist loose, and do not brace it hard, because stiffness smothers its language like a hand over a mouth. If you feel a slow, even pulse you are over old wood or a drowned beam, but if the pulse staggers into a double step and your teeth feel a whisper, that is worked bronze answering a larger choir. Do not strike the Pin against the boat or the bell; it is an ear, not a hammer, and ears bruise easily. When you lift the tongue, keep it wet until we can bathe it in clean river water, because dried peat cracks inscriptions the way an argument splits a council.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Tidecall\", \"lines\": \"You’re heading into water that looks like a floor until you step and find a stair, so keep your weight where Tala tells you and quit showing off for any ghosts with kind faces. The Covenant’s flood-bells heard that second note too, and half my helms think it’s a blessing while the other half think it’s a toll we forgot to pay, so expect nerves and fools if word spreads. If reedcutters step out with toll-smiles and long poles, remember they know the channels like we know chain links, and a wrong shove makes you a story told with a wink and a shrug. Come back with that tongue and I’ll see a path for legit barges through a lane we’ve had to ignore for seasons, which will spin House Kelvar’s tide-clock hands the wrong way for a change. And Jaryn, if you feel the hum in your bones start to stagger, you sing back with your breath and your boots steady, because a crew that hears its steerswoman in the dark doesn’t break apart.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rook Salter\", \"lines\": \"You drift into our cut like you own the water, and the reeds part for you like they don’t mind, but everything that moves here pays a tithe in hush or coin. I’ve got men who carve their bread from peat and glass their eyes against gnat fever, and I won’t see them starve while city folk chase echoes and call it holy. Drop a purse, nod to the reeds, and we’ll forget we saw you, because forgetting is a kindness we’ve learned to sell. Or stay proud and keep your lantern bright, and see how many lamp-eels learn to taste its glow while your barge sinks polite as a curtsey. Don’t quote me river law; the only charter that survives here is written in mud and cut by poles.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tala Fenmint\", \"lines\": \"There, hear it, like a cough under a blanket, two beats late and older than we are, and the Pin wants to dance from my fingers when we pass that rack of wax-bark roots. We’ll set the sling and nest it like a cradle, not a noose, and we’ll lift on your breath when my hand falls to count, because breathing with the fen keeps it from noticing our theft. Keep the lamp shuttered to a nail’s width so we see when the lamp-eels flare black and not a heartbeat more, and mind your boots because suction peat loves a careless heel. If fog tries on your mother’s voice or a friend you can’t quite place, answer with a lie you both can live with and keep your eyes on the rope. When the tongue breaks water, praise it, praise the mud, and praise the poor fool who cast it, because gratitude greases luck better than oil.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Harmonic Dusk Approach\", \"text\": \"You propose waiting until true dusk, when the Shard’s exhale settles across the fen and the Asterion Tuning Pin will sing truest, even if it means spending more hours in gnat-thick air. You will drift without oars, letting the slow current carry you over likely pockets while Tala murmurs counts and you test the Pin above each black mirror. The lamp will stay shuttered to a sliver and you will signal by finger-tap and rope-tug, turning the search into a quiet ritual rather than a race. You accept that patience invites curiosities—shapes in fog, reeds breathing like lungs—but you trust that listening longer than you speak will earn the fen’s cooperation. You will not challenge reedcutters or stir eels, because you will refuse every urge except the urge to hear the right note and honor it.\", \"outcome\": \"The Pin quivers in your hand like a bird in a child’s pocket, and when you mark the site, the second note answers with a shy, double-stepped pulse that guides Tala’s sling true. Because you did not stir the water with oars, the lamp-eels remain curious rather than ravenous, and they ribbon beneath the hull like dark thread rather than knots. A fenwife’s silhouette climbs the gunwale and asks for a name you cannot give, yet your silence confuses her and she slips away like mist burned off by a hidden sun. Rook Salter’s men watch from a distance, bored by your lack of theater and disappointed by the absence of a pretext to sell you protection, and you pass with only a single shouted jest left to sink. The tongue rises whole, its inscriptions filmed with peat but unscarred, and on your return you learn from Mara that your restraint has made a map: a new, quiet lane where legit barges can move, which folds neatly into the goodwill you’ll bank with the Pilots’ Covenant.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Vow of Clean Crossing\", \"text\": \"You take your Copper Ward-Tile and press it to your tongue until it tastes of pennies and thunder, and you speak a vow that binds your breath and boat to a clean crossing if the fen returns the bell’s truth unharmed. You ask Tala to echo you, not as a priest would but as a friend, and you let the river hear the shape of your promise as the Shard’s distant hum braids with it. You set a small offering in a wax-bark cup—reed-mint, a thread of your rope, and one story about the time you forgot who taught you to splice a line—and you float it into the reeds. You agree to answer no fog-voices and trade no memories that you cannot afford to lose, even if the shadow wears a kindness you miss. When the Pin trembles, you will lift with gratitude and speak thanks before you touch bronze, because you will pretend the mud is a partner instead of a thief.\", \"outcome\": \"The fog rises around your vow like an old aunt adjusting a shawl, and the water stills to a mirror that shows the boat as it would look if fear were a color, and you do not flinch. The Pin answers with a warm, steady quiver and the sling seats itself without a scrape; when you pull, the peat sighs like a locked chest opening for its rightful key. A fenwife appears at your shoulder and asks for the promised story, but the Ward-Tile on your tongue hums and the words blur, and the shadow smiles as if relieved that you kept them safe. The tongue surfaces bright with silt and a line of characters shines where the mud let go clean, but you notice a tug inside, a debt due: a winter from now, you must escort a nameless barge through this lane without pay, and you accept the mark on your calendar. On the tow back, a band of reedcutters falls in at a distance and then peels away, muttering that oaths spoil business, and your passage seeds a rumor that the lane belongs to vows rather than ambushes, which the Covenant later praises with a nod that counts as coin.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Chain and Hook Gambit\", \"text\": \"You choose to move fast and hard, rigging a chain-anchored pulley to a wax-bark root and setting eel-nets under the hull so that any bite will be punished by barbs rather than paid with blood. You keep the lamp unshuttered to dare the lamp-eels to gather where you can see them, and you post yourself on the bow with barge-hook leveled for pole-thrusts that will keep reedcutters at polite distances. The Pin you use like a compass, flicking quick tests and trusting your pilot’s instinct to circle and pounce when the tremble aligns with Tala’s count. You plan to make noise, because noise can be a kind of ward when men prefer to hunt things that think they are hidden. You promise Tala you’ll be precise as a crane crew on a good day, and you remind her that sometimes the river respects a bold haul more than a whispered plea.\", \"outcome\": \"The eels come, all teeth and flickers, and the nets sing with their anger while the lamp throws hard shadows that make the fog hesitate; you strike poles away from the sling, and the mud releases its grip in a single, grudging belch. Rook Salter takes your noise for invitation and slithers in with four longboats, but your chain anchor turns his first shove into embarrassment and he loses a poleman to the drink, forcing him to curse and parley. You buy your space with stern words and a promise of a future crossing schedule that leaves them a legal ferry-right, and they back water with bruised pride but lingering respect. The tongue rises with a nick on its edge where the chain kissed it, but the inscriptions are whole and the Shard’s distant hum reaches for it like a parent calls a child in from dusk play. On the return run, word of your rough passage travels faster than your wake, and while the Order later scolds you for noise in a sacred harmonics field, the Covenant quietly admires that you broke a bad habit along a good route and hands you a list of barges ready to try the lane while the reedcutters remember how your hook wrote your name in their water.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M3\"], \"next\": [\"M5\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Relic\", \"description\": \"Bell-Tongue of the Unbuilt Temple that resonates softly whenever the Shard’s hum shifts, a bronze memory that answers the city’s pinned star with a shy, double-stepped note.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Supplies\", \"description\": \"Fenmint Salve Kit refills and an extra reed-mint charm braided against fever gnats, cool on the skin and sharp in the nose when the fens breathe close.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Pilots’ Covenant goodwill for opening a safe smuggler channel to legit traffic, recorded as a quiet commendation that buys tow-hands, convoy preference, and a shouted name at flood-bell muster.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
