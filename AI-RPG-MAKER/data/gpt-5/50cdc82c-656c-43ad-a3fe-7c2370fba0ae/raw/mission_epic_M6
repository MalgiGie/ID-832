In Erynn Mirrorfall’s studio, sheets of stained emberglass leaned like frozen waves against the wall, and a sketch of sigils and pour-lines mapped a lacquer that would cradle the Shard’s song without rousing sleepers to wander rooftops like moths. She had coaxed a recipe from old guild notes and a whisper traded under bead-curtains, a resin-lacquer that needed night-sap from the Moonless Orchard gathered at the boundary where the Order’s consecrated stakes falter and the Night Orchard’s shadow-wards begin their hush. Jaya Basaltrip of the Asterion Collegium would meet there with instruments humming a counter-chord, ready to bind the sap before the grove’s half-dream could lean its thumb into the mixture and smudge all sums, and Lysa Shardhands, an Order warden with command in her voice like a chime, had sworn she would look the other way until true night’s first bead fell from the sky. Yet the grove had its own arithmetic: directions kinked, compass needles sighed, and fear went slack while debts of memory came due; in that shade Jaryn Chainwake had once eaten night-fruit and lost the shape of a kindness, a laughter on a ropewalk, the scent of tar and rain-wet hemp, a lantern glow caught in someone’s lashes. Now the city’s sleepwalkers drifted at dusk, following the Shard’s strengthened hum as if tides moved in their blood, and the lacquer might counsel the light to be gentler, a hand smoothing a brow. To walk the Orchard’s hem was to risk being walked by your own past, to meet a memory set free like a stray dog, to be asked if you would call it back or let it vanish a second time for the sake of a city that needed quiet nights. Between the ward-stakes and the shadowed hedge, between measured counts and murmured promises, the work would be done or not at all, and all debts would be tallied in light and silence. The Luthien ran friendly beyond the grove, but under the leaves it was a river of another kind, one that ran through voices, names, and the places where vows were tied too loosely and slipped.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Erynn Mirrorfall and Jaya Basaltrip at the edge of the Moonless Orchard.\",\n        \"Collect night-sap from marked quince and smoky plum trees without stepping into full shade.\",\n        \"Assist Jaya in mixing the resin-lacquer and test it on lantern panes.\",\n        \"Evade Night Orchard watchers and respect the Order’s boundary conditions.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Erynn Mirrorfall\", \"lines\": \"Light can be shaped like a hymn and held like a hand, and I have spent half my life learning which lead-lines make it gentler and which edges make it cruel. The city is tired, Jaryn, and the Shard has been singing louder of late, louder than my panes can soften without help, as if our nights have become a bell the size of a river. This lacquer is not a gag for the song nor a chain for the light; it is a shawl to wrap around a fevered child until the heat passes and real rest is possible again. I have studied the old recipes, the drafts that were hidden after the Nightfall edicts, and they all whispered the same thing: ‘Take the sap at the border, under eyes that do not blink and before night truly opens its mouth.’ I know the risk, and I do not ask lightly, but I ask you because you carry the river’s codes in your bones and because I see the way you listen before you act, the way a pilot waits for the next chord of the current before setting the oar.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaya Basaltrip\", \"lines\": \"The sap is temperamental and storied, like a singer who remembers every hall that ever held her voice and judges you on the acoustics of your soul. It remembers promises made in a whisper and it sulks if you lie, and it does not like to be taken past the first bead of true night, when the grove’s breath deepens and words begin to echo with their own shadows. We’ll mix it at the boundary so the night doesn’t press its thumb through our sums, because even a small smear of dream on the figures will pull the varnish toward sorrow instead of solace. I will count in primes and pause on breaths that match the Shard’s hum, and when I say stop, you stop, even if the tree croons your name like the one person whose forgiveness you keep pretending you don’t need. We will carry copper ward-tiles to ground the math, we will keep to the sun-touched roots, and we will not let the grove talk us into thinking we have more time than we do, because direction is a creature here and it enjoys slipping its leash.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lysa Shardhands\", \"lines\": \"You will hear me say I did not see you cross that last white thread of dust on the rootline, and that will be the end of it so long as the work is done before true night and no bark is cut deeper than a single tear-drop of sap. The Order’s edicts are not curios in a case, they are braces that keep a cracked wall standing, and I have pledged to keep the wall from falling even if it means letting a craftsman slip through a door that should be locked for another hour. Bring your tiles and bind your oaths to them, and if you must speak a promise to the sap, make it a truth that will not sour when the dawn admits how little romance there is in exhaustion. Know this too: if I see Night Orchard gardeners pruning more than rumor out here, my patience ends like a rope under sudden strain, and I will call wardens to this shade even if the Shard itself sings me deaf. I look the other way because I trust the shape of your intent, Jaryn Chainwake, but trust is a pane that can spider with one sharp tap, and I have seen too many spiderwebs in the courts this year.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iven Shadequinch\", \"lines\": \"You step close to a hedge we have tended with black-sap and patience and, like all careful gardeners, we notice a new hand reaching for fruit at the fence. We do not sell death and we do not tax kindness, but we prune threats, and a clumsy harvest can make a city dream itself into a ditch from which it will wake with broken teeth. Take only from the trees we have marked with a twist of char on the bark, and leave a leaf-fold promise beneath each cut, a small tithe of word to pay for the bruise you’ve asked the tree to wear. We have no quarrel with easing sleep, but understand that the Orchard itself remembers debts, and if you carry more than your share, it will follow you like a rumor until it finds a place to root in your life. Speak your purpose plain at the root-line, and if you mean to chase a memory through our shade, do not expect the path to walk straight for you twice in one night, because even kindness grows wild when unpruned.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jaryn Chainwake\", \"lines\": \"The Orchard took a piece of me once and I have worn the hole like a badge I don’t show, a neat absence that my fingers still map when storms lean against the city and old knots pull in the wood. If I am given the chance to patch it, I won’t grab like a thief or bargain like a counting-hall clerk; I will ask, and if the trees answer, I will take what is offered and no more, and I will leave thanks folded under the skin of the root. I will walk the hem as pilots walk a floodline, with a hand on the chain and an ear for the bell, and I will keep to light where light keeps to me, because I have seen what happens when a man thinks he can outsmart a river that is older than his family’s name. If a shadow leans close and calls me by a name I can’t quite feel, I will set my feet in Jaya’s counts and anchor my breath to the Shard’s low note, and let the lacquer set even while my heartbeat tries to run ahead. I came to keep crossings open, and tonight the crossing is between waking and sleep, between wanting a memory for myself and needing a city to rest, and I will not let my hunger turn me into a sandbar that wrecks a convoy of quiet nights.\"\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Honor the Boundary\", \"text\": \"You refuse the deeper call of the Orchard and keep to the border stakes where the Shard’s blue breath still reaches like a lantern’s leash. You kneel at the marked quince and smoky plum, coaxing each tear of sap with a thumb-warm blade and a steady count, and you fold leaves over the cuts as if tucking a child in against a draft. You stop whenever Jaya pauses, letting the numbers settle like silt while the grove sighs and your forgotten laughter paces just out of sight like a stray dog that is not yours to call. You nod to Lysa when she looks away, feeling the weight of her trust like a borrowed tool that must be returned without a nick, and you tip your chin to Iven’s hedge without crossing it. You test the mix on a small pane and watch the glow become a hush that still shines, a quiet brightness that does not tug at your bones, and you know the city will sleep easier for at least a while.\", \"outcome\": \"The lacquer binds clean, the pane’s hum rounding its edges until it feels like a hand smoothing a brow, and Erynn’s eyes salt with relief that she quickly dries on her sleeve. The Order’s patience grows by a measured half-hand, not enough to buy a pardon but enough to earn a nod at the next checkpoint, and Lysa’s report will read like a stern hymn with a soft refrain. The Night Orchard does not follow your steps, leaving your name to rustle only briefly in their hedges, and Iven’s people will describe you as one who understood fences before they were instructed. You do not reclaim the whole of your missing kindness, but the ropewalk returns to you in a half-remembered stanza—tar-scent, rain on tiles, and a voice laughing because you dared the highest beam—and it settles in your chest like a warm stone. The city gains a crate of gentling light and a promise that more can be made, the Collegium files a letter of thanks that opens a door two hallways hence, and the night that follows is quieter by a chorus you cannot hear until you notice what is not happening.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Pursue the Walking Memory\", \"text\": \"When the laughter you forgot steps across the shade like a tide-line shape and looks back, you follow it, measuring your breaths against Jaya’s counts until the numbers blur into a hum and the hum becomes a path. You keep to roots that remember sunlight, but the Orchard bends distance into a ripple and you find yourself two steps deeper, where leaves sip starlight before it reaches the ground and direction tastes sweet and wrong on your tongue. You see the figure of the kindness you lost—hands powdered with rope dust, eyes bright with dare and care—and you ask it to stop, which it does not, not at first, not until you say the name you think might be right, voice shaking like a line under strain. You cut sap carefully, faster than is wise and slower than your hunger, and you carry it back with pockets of darkness clinging to the seams of your thoughts like burrs after a fen-walk. You feel Lysa’s patience shiver when she senses the line you crossed, and you feel the Night Orchard’s gaze settle like dew on your shoulders, cool and kind up to the point that it is not.\", \"outcome\": \"The lacquer you and Jaya mix is deeper, more resonant, and when it settles on the pane it hushes the Shard’s tug with a compassion that feels almost like memory soothing a fever, and Erynn breathes out as if she has been standing on tiptoe all week. The Order’s report will carry a hairline crack of concern through Lysa’s handwriting, a note about ‘exceeding the white dust’, and while no summons arrives tonight, your name will ring a little louder among wardens with long memories. The Night Orchard marks you as one who let the grove answer a debt; Iven’s gardeners tilt their heads when you pass and a child will one day press a folded leaf into your palm with a rumor tucked inside it like a seed. You reclaim a sharper slice of your lost kindness—the joke you told at the ropewalk, the hand that steadied your heel, the promise you made to meet at Riverwake and the fact that you did—but something small slips away in exchange, the exact day a friend taught you crane-sign, a tinsmith’s name, a minor truth you will not miss until you need it. The city sleeps better for a span, the lacquer’s recipe is richer, and you walk away with a new quiet in your mouth where a word used to be, tasting like sap that never quite loses its sweetness.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bargain with the Night Orchard\", \"text\": \"You step to the hedge and speak in the careful cadence of those who remember being ferried at night, offering a tithe of word and a promise of craft in exchange for safe harvest along lines they choose. You promise to leave a leaf-fold under every cut and a vial of finished lacquer at a root of their naming, and you ask nothing more than that your steps run true and your shadows do not argue with each other. Iven listens without blinking and names three trees with char-twists, each in a place where the light and dark braid together like hair, and you agree to cut only there even if sweeter sap gleams elsewhere like wet coin. Lysa bristles, because bargains in shade taste of loopholes, but she allows the ritual if the oaths kiss the copper tile first, and Jaya reworks her counts to account for the black-sap’s watchful weight. You gather clean, pour true, and in the end you lay a small, humming vial at the hedge’s foot like a lantern turned inward, and you feel the rumor-vines accept it the way a wall accepts ivy: with patience and a plan.\", \"outcome\": \"The mixture sets obedient as a well-trained current, and the test pane glows with a velvety restraint that kisses the chamber’s edges without tugging at a single heartbeat, and Erynn calls it a hymn someone can sleep beside. The Night Orchard’s ledger of favors puts a green mark beside your name and files it under promises kept, which is better than under debts, and you sense their gardeners pruning a rumor that might have cut you next month if left to grow. The Order eyes your diplomacy with the suspicion of carpenters who know that even a true level can hide a crooked beam, and Lysa warns that her indulgence has limits, but she does not strike your name from her ledger of trusted hands. The Collegium appreciates the field calibration and the sample’s quiet potency, and Jaya writes a note that will open a back door at the oculus tower, though it also binds you to answer a question when asked at a later date. Your memory does not bloom fully, but a soft echo returns—the curve of a smile and the pressure of a palm between your shoulders before a hard climb—and you walk out with both a crate of balm for the city and a thread tied to a syndicate hedge that will tug when the season changes.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M5\"], \"next\": [\"M7\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Crate of Resonant Resin-Lacquer, a set of vials and brushed panes that gently reduces sleepwalking within a small warded area without muting the Shard’s song.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"A letter of thanks from the Asterion Collegium, improving their trust and opening future collaboration on harmonics and field tests.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Memory\", \"description\": \"Personal memory fragment: a half-remembered laughter at a ropewalk, hinting at the kindness you lost and guiding future choices in quiet ways.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
