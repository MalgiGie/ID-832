As a teen he hauled lines in Chainward, learned crane-sign, and stood as a hook guard on barge convoys when toll feuds ran hot. The Pilots’ Covenant took him on as a shieldman during spring surges, where he earned his surname hauling a snapped toll-chain clear in a flood. He later rotated to union watchlines at the House of Reconciliation, helping keep tempers from becoming torches when heat-levy caps were fought. He respects the Order of the Shard’s wardens but bristles at rites that halt work on hungry days. He has ferried scholars of the Asterion Collegium to measure the Shard’s song, and once escorted a night-sap run near the Moonless Orchard where he tasted the fruit and forgot who first taught him to splice a rope. Jaryn avoids House Kelvar debt ledgers, having watched friends drown in numbers. He keeps the river’s codes, can hear when the Shard hums louder before a storm, and carries both blade and barge-hook with the practiced calm of a crane crew chief. With rumors of convoys being trimmed by unseen hands, he has begun to gather a small band willing to guard routes that guild charters neglect.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Emberglass Falchion\", \"description\": \"A single-edged blade cast in the Emberglass Foundry, tempered to drink dusk-light and hold a keen edge in wet.
