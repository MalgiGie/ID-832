    "description": "Lanternstep’s oculus tower wheeled its brass-limned lenses like patient moons, and the floors beneath them breathed a faint, crystalline hum each time the Shard exhaled its dusk-light into the city. Neris Aline awaited Jaryn Chainwake beneath hanging meridians, charts spread like river fans, their vellum pricked by tiny, relentless notes of ink that marked when sleepers had risen and walked in rain or frost, eyes half-lidded and feet sure as if some invisible stair had unrolled before them. She spoke of the harmonizer—a device meant to bend storms into calmer chords—and how its mercy had lured another song into Cyrasha’s marrow, a cadence that tugged at the unwary and drew them toward water, glass, and the Shard’s quiet throat. If the city’s pillars—bridge, foundry, and orchard-shade—were resonating together in a drifted key, then the fault lay not only in scholarship but in the knots between guild, river, and vow. Jaryn’s name carried through those knots like a well-tied line: he had hauled in flood, kept tempers banked at the House of Reconciliation, and signaled truth across mist with a prism-lamp whose shutters never lied. Neris pressed a velvet-wrapped probe into his hand and asked him to listen where others argued, to measure where others forbade, and to carry back not only numbers but the shape of the night’s breath upon the city’s bones.",

It worked, in a fashion, but it taught the bird a strange song, and now it flies at night and perches upon the minds of sleepers. People are walking in their sleep, Jaryn, and their steps are too even to be chance, as if a metronome made of river and glass clicks behind their ribs. They are walking toward the water or the Shard without knowing their names, as if those names have been set to a key they can no longer hear awake. I need to know if the city is singing too loudly or if someone else is humming in the marrow of our bridges, because numbers without courage will not save a single dreamer from the current. Take this probe and listen at the Chainbridge Crown, at the Foundry’s cooling gardens where breath turns to pane, and at the Orchard’s boundary where vows are remembered by shade. Bring me not only measures but the story of how you were allowed to listen, for the permissions we borrow will tell me which factions are already leaning into the song and which resist it. If wardens raise their hands, show them your copper tile and your clean intent, and if guilders spit blame, ask them who profits from a city that sleepwalks."

            "lines": "I carry a copper tile and I carry respect, and I have learned that neither weighs much if the bearer’s spine is bent by fear. I’ve hauled your wardens when the river rose and I’ve held a line while the city argued, and the Shard’s breath has cooled the sweat off my back more nights than I can count. Neris, I have seen what happens when ledgers steer a current and when zeal turns a bridge into a wall, so I will walk soft and I will not let either write the ending of this errand. We will not force a chord into the Shard; we will not press where the stone still remembers silence and where prayer is a kind of engineering. We’re trying to hear if something else already has, and I will set the probe like a listener at a threshold, not a thief at a lock. Stand with me while I listen, Lysa, should you meet me there, and if the song bites, we’ll both feel the teeth and decide whether to bind or to bleed. And if a guild foreman or a counting hall sends a glare across my path, I’ll trade words before blows, because I need their truth to weigh the drift of this hum as surely as I need the readings."

            "lines": "I will not have meddlers setting new notes against the Shard without sanction, and I will not pretend that your pretty instruments cannot push as well as listen. The Bastion remembers seven breaths of silence; that memory is a knife we live above every day, and I still wake at times with the taste of that quiet like iron on my tongue. You say you will only listen, and perhaps you are the sort who keeps a promise even when your boots are on a sacred stair, but many have said as much and cut deeper than they claimed. If you take readings, take them with reverence and without devices that push, and you will take them in my sight upon the Chainbridge so that I may judge the tilt of your hands and the patience of your waiting. Show me your tile, speak your oath plain, and I will step aside, but I will listen for lies and I will know if you try to hum along. The city forgets that law is a kind of music, Jaryn, scored by vows and pauses, and I will not let a sloppy measure drag us back to silence. Give me the names of any who hinder you, and I will decide whether to bind their tongues or their wrists, but do not mistake my help for surrender."

You come with a probe and a lamp and a worker’s gait, and I see the Union’s discipline in how you plant your feet when the heat licks, so speak the truth and speak it long. We heard the sleepwalkers too; one of my lads nearly walked a straight line into a spill-trench as if it were a bed, and I caught him by the apron strings and swore I heard a chord snap in his breath. If your listening can tell me when the air is about to bend, I will let you walk the troughs with a guide, and I will clap my foremen’s mouths shut so the rumor does not run hotter than the kilns. But if your gear sparks, if a single pane crazes because you set a wrong hum in the glass, I will pull your probe like a nail from rotten wood and throw it and you into the cooling pond. Bring me something I can give to my crews—words they can trust about why the night tries to stand them up—and I will owe you a favor sealed with heat."

I’ve watched the shade here swallow fear like a sugared plum, and I’ve watched it spit up courage in a shape a person does not recognize until after they’ve acted, so keep your name tied to your wrist like a charm. Your probe will hear more than tones if you set it in the leaf-lull, it will hear the way people remember promises they never spoke aloud, and that may pull at your own unthreaded kindnesses. The Night Orchard claims roots here, and some of their gardeners think all songs are branches to be pruned, so if a black-sap contract is offered, read it with your palm before your eyes. I will stand with you in the edge-twilight and watch your back for fox-breath, and if the path doubles under our feet, I will lay a reed line so we can find ourselves again. Do not answer the orchard when it calls you by a childhood name you forgot; it is polite here to let some ghosts go hungry."

The Crown’s mid-span sings louder on fog nights, not because the Shard is closer but because fear tightens throats and makes metal kinder to your ear, so set your probe with your breath held on the exhale. Signal me if a warden squares up or a Kelvar bead-counter tries to tally your steps, and I’ll float a flatboat under you with bells muffled, in case you need a fast downriver truth. Remember the Covenant’s rule: you never name a dead current, and right now I smell a current that has not been properly born, so don’t you dare christen it with a brave word. When you return, bring me the drift of the numbers in plain speech and the drift of the faces you had to persuade; a map is useless to me without the weather it was drawn in. And if your lamp needs to sing in code because talking would be a mistake, give me the old hook-guard rhythm and I’ll answer with a tow-line like a promise."

            "text": "You choose to meet Lysa Shardhands at the Chainbridge Crown in full view of wardens and riverfolk, your copper tile displayed and your oath spoken slowly enough that the bridge can learn it. You invite her to stand within arm’s length as you deploy the probe, narrating each motion like a litany so that reverence and method keep pace. You let the night’s breeze and the Shard’s dusk-breath settle, timing your readings to the lull between footsteps on the span so the human rhythm does not muddy the city’s. You answer every question as if it were a bell strike, clear and measured, including why the harmonizer was built and what it has accidentally taught the air. You accept that this choice will cost you speed for the sake of legitimacy, and you plan to carry Lysa’s scrutiny like a lantern that reveals both danger and safe footing.",
            "outcome": "Lysa watches with a soldier’s patience and a priest’s suspicion, yet she cannot deny your steadiness or the way your hands keep to the promise of listening and not pushing. The probe registers a deepening drift near the mid-span, a layered beat that rides the chains like a second pulse, and Lysa’s jaw tightens when you speak the measure back to her. She grants you written leave to make two more readings under her name, which buys you safe passage at the Foundry gate and a colder welcome at the Orchard edge, because the Night Orchard trusts few signatures. Word spreads that the Order’s warden stood by and did not strike your device from your hand, which raises your standing among law-abiders and paints a quiet target on your back among those who prefer the Shard be feared rather than understood. When you return to Neris, your data is clean and your conscience lighter, and the confirmation that the drift is strongest at the Crown rings like a bell that refuses to be unheard."

            "text": "You decide that a public oath will draw too many eyes and you move by the river’s older laws, gripping shadow and rhythm the way a pilot grips a tow in flood. At the Crown you time your steps to the lull between patrol glances, and your prism-lamp speaks in clipped shutters to allies below who bathe the bridge’s undershadows in safe blue. At the Foundry you wait for the hiss of steam to cover the probe’s soft click, marking your measures between gusts that carry grit and the tang of heated sand. At the Orchard’s edge you count your own breaths to keep direction from slipping, and you test the boundary with reed-fingers and quiet, refusing to answer when the shade tries to sound like home. This is a choice that risks misunderstanding; success will be quick and clean if you are unseen, but a single misstep will bring questions you cannot answer with a bow and a tile.",
            "outcome": "Your stealth holds at the Crown and the reading there trembles the probe’s needle in a way that makes you think of heartbeat instead of wind, a confirmation that chills even without a witness. At the Foundry a drifting sleepwalker appears among the mould racks, fingers reaching as if to test the cooling panes, and you must catch him gently and guide him to a bench without breaking silence, leaving only a folded note that says the night is playing tricks with names. The Orchard balks at your subtlety; the shade simmers and your lamp’s smallest flicker draws a fox of shadow-curled breath, but you finish the reading with a ward whispered against old promises and slip away without leaving a track. When the Order hears secondhand that someone took measures without sanction, suspicion blooms, yet your careful trail leaves no grip for an arrest, and even Lysa’s informants can only swear that a respectful ghost moved there. Neris receives data as sharp as a cut glass edge and a story told in finger-taps and margins, and together you mark the Crown as the strongest drift while agreeing that your shadow-work will need a public counterbalance soon to keep peace."

            "text": "You call in quiet favors at the House of Reconciliation and ask Hearth Union stewards to stage a boiler inspection drill, the kind that clears a lane through the Foundry without raising hackles. You brief Borgo Emberdell in plain speech, promising him no glass will craze and that any time you borrow from his crews you will repay with a safety checklist they can keep. During the drill, foremen shout practice orders and workers move like a rehearsed river, and you slip through their gaps with probe in hand, counting beats by the cadence of hammers on empty anvils. At the Crown you show a drill-writ in your pocket when a warden squints your way, and your lamp blinks a union-safe code that says necessity, not mischief. The Orchard is last, and you arrive with the smell of kiln-sweat still on your clothes, reminding yourself to lay down the Foundry’s heat before you touch a place that keeps old shade-cool promises.",
            "outcome": "The diversion holds like a well-lashed raft, and Borgo keeps his word with a nod as he watches you set the probe beside the cooling troughs, giving you heat-shielders who make curious walls with their backs. Your reading at the Foundry reveals a treble sheen to the drift, a high thread laid over the Crown’s deep pulse, and the workers admit the hum eases just before the worst dream-walks start, as if a lullaby were turning knives inside out. House Kelvar’s bead-counters arrive late and frown at the lost minutes, marking your face in their ledgers, but they hold their tongues because the Union drill is a ritual of safety no one dares disparage. At the Crown your drill-writ buys cordial indifference and at the Orchard it earns a tired smile from Tala, who jokes that fire and shade do not often share a schedule, then watches your line as you listen. You return to Neris with readings that ring in layers, a favor owed by a foreman with soot on his hands, and a note that Kelvar eyes will weigh your steps more carefully, all of which you both count as the price of clean truth."

You step onto sap-slick loam with Tala Fenmint at your elbow and announce your intention as if speaking to an elder, offering a reed-tithe and a promise not to cut living wood. When the Gardener’s envoy appears—eyes like wet bark and voice like a hush—you state that your listening will not trade in names, only in measures, and that you ask for a quiet path and not a leash. In exchange you are offered black-sap counsel: a rumor-route that will keep wardens and bead-counters looking elsewhere for an hour, and a warning that the orchard has heard a fourth note under the city’s three. You know that this choice writes a favor into your skin, and that someday a gardener will point you toward a pruning you may not stomach, but you weigh it against the safety of the dream-walking poor and nod once as if before a flood.",
            "outcome": "The Orchard grants you a corridor of misdirection that smells of quince smoke, and your steps pass unremarked where eyes should have fixed upon you, letting the probe drink in the boundary’s murmurs untroubled. The reading there shows a knot of vow-resonance, small and sharp, that seems to tick louder when you speak softly, and Tala’s fingers drum an old fen lullaby to keep your names from wandering. At the Foundry the misdirection lingers just long enough to turn a foreman’s irritation into bemused patience, and at the Crown it nudges a patrol’s path three breaths behind your shadow, confirming without confrontation that the chains carry the strongest drift. The price comes due in a letter left in the throw of your harness: a request that you testify in neutral words at the House of Reconciliation about a matter of rumor and mercy, and you know the Night Orchard is pruning by making you a witness. Neris accepts the data with relief and the debt with a scholar’s frown, yet even she admits that sometimes the city’s own roots must be asked to lift their skirts so measurements can be taken without breaking ankles, and together you mark the Crown’s strength in the drift while keeping one eye on the future’s quiet knives."
