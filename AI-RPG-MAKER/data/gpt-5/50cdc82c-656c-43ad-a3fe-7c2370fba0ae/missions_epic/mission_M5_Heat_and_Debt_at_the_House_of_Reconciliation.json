    "description": "The House of Reconciliation breathed steam and promise as dusk laid the Shard’s cool glow upon the murals of clasped hands and chains reset. Benches polished by a thousand quarrels creaked under the weight of guilders, pilots, foundry hands, and debt-ranked factors, all watching the long dais where Ina Peppercoal stirred a cauldron with one hand and fingered an oath-string with the other. Winter pressed like thin wool against the doors, and the draft that whispered under the sill smelled of frost and coal that might not be bought if ledgers had their way. You arrived with the Bell-Tongue of the Unbuilt Temple wrapped in rivercloth, the bit of fen-won bronze that murmured when the Shard sang loud, and the room hushed as Ina nodded for you to set it on the dais so all might hear the city’s second note. Thane Kelvar came in with ledger beads braided through his hair and the calm of a man for whom numbers made weather, and Mara Tidecall prowled near the door like a tide held too long behind a sandbar, her eyes on the toll-chain seals stamped into the house’s pillars. Somewhere beneath the floorboards the quiet tunnels whispered their old city secrets, and the copper ward-tiles on the rafters winked like patient stars. Here, where you had once learned to uncoil your voice without drawing blood, braziers glowed, oaths waited, and the question rose: would iron or fire settle the winter, or would words and the bell’s uncertain chime hold the river’s course steady long enough for bread to reach the poor and the ledgers not to drown the city?",

        "Broker a compromise between the Pilots’ Covenant and House Kelvar to keep tolls stable during convoy windows (define windows and freezes clearly).",
        "Secure a formal heat-levy cap without provoking a strike or a crackdown (win warmth without war)."

I will not see this house turned into a kiln for rage when we can make it a hearth for sense, because a hearth feeds even when tempers crackle like kindling. Sit, breathe, and listen to that little bell you hauled out of a grave of mud, because it carries a murmur older than our ledgers and kinder than our tempers. It says the world is stranger than any contract, and that none of us can claim to count every current or predict every gust, not even the ones who live by tide-clocks and sums. Let it remind you that we don’t know everything, and then speak for what we do know: no child unheated, no elder turned away from a brazier, no barge turned back at dusk when grain rides its planks and frost hunts the window seams."

Risk is a real thing, and the river has teeth that bite without pity when fog and flood and Shard-moods align into dark arithmetic. If the city demands we float credit into uncertainty, then the city must pay a tide for it, because our silver does not grow scales and swim itself back into our coffers. I will not write my clan into ruin for pretty words and a relic that hums when it fancies, nor will I be stamped a miser for refusing to name a storm ‘sunshine’ just because we wish it so. Persuade me with measures and safeguards that balance outlay and hazard, bind them in a form that admits no wiggle of mischief, and you’ll have terms that leave none of us drowned, neither debtor nor factor, neither pilot nor porter."

My pilots have run grain past flood-teeth by lantern and prayer, and they will do it again if given a fair channel and a steady number that doesn’t jump like a spooked carp. Freeze the tolls for convoy windows we name by bell and chart, and we will swear on rope and salt that we’ll make those windows or swallow the forfeit without a whine. We don’t ask to sail free like myths; we ask for numbers that don’t turn on us in the night and for heat-levies that don’t gut a house’s pantry by the second week of frost. Give us that, and the flood-bells will ring for grain and not for grief, and the river will sing names at the Chanting Ford that mean ‘kept promise’ instead of ‘priced mercy’."

We at the Collegium have measured drift these last moons: small, but present, enough to make honest chart-keepers cautious and to make the superstitious whisper loud. No instrument we trust can yet predict the pattern with precision, and that is the point—uncertainty is a fact that should temper greed and panic alike. If we accept that the hum can nudge currents, we should also accept that rigid rates tied to false certainty are a cruelty disguised as law. Let the bell stand as witness that our knowledge has edges, and craft terms that honor those edges without inviting chaos or clever exploitation."

Set convoy windows where the Pilots can guarantee passage and name them in this hall with ward-tiles warm, and for those windows you freeze your tolls like winter glass so no factor’s thumb can smudge the number. If we miss the window, we pay the penalty written here and witnessed by the bell and the Order’s seal, but if we make it, the grain moves and the stoves burn without whispers of theft dressed up as policy. We bind it with a ward-oath that no clerk may pinch for favor or fear, we nail it to the House board, and we all sign—Pilots, Kelvar, Union, and a neutral hand from the Twelve Seals. And let the bell sit at the door so anyone who leaves hears it speak before they step back into the street, because a city that listens to its second note is harder to fool and kinder to live in."

            "title": "The Convoy-Window Pact",
            "text": "You propose a precise schedule hammered from pilot charts and winter forecasts, naming three convoy windows each ten days apart and marked by the flood-bell code. You set the Bell-Tongue upon the dais and stipulate that during those windows the tolls at the Chanting Ford are frozen at the current rate, with no surcharges or ‘risk premiums’ allowed. You offer a good-faith surety: should a convoy miss its window due to pilot error rather than flood or harmonic anomaly, the Pilots’ Covenant pays a fixed forfeit into a shared bread fund administered by the House of Reconciliation. You add that the heat-levy cap will be bound at a level set the previous winter, adjusted only by coal price and not by speculative fear, and enforceable by ward-oath with the Order witnessing. You speak calmly but with your river’s weight behind you, reminding each side that a promise spoken here echoes along the chains to strangers fated to help, and the room leans in to the bell’s soft answering hum.",
            "outcome": "The pact is adopted after tense counting and two pauses for Ina’s ladle to cool tempers, and the House of Reconciliation’s oaken board takes four seals in warm copper. Trollish mutters from a few factors fade when Mara lays down a pilot’s oath and Thane, seeing the surety’s fairness, countersigns with precise flourish. The heat-levy cap is affirmed with a clause that ties any change to the House’s public coal index and not to Kelvar whim, and Hearth Union stewards breathe out like bellows easing. Convoys move on the first window under a sky that tries to snow and fails, and the tollmen at the Ford hold their chains slack, grim but compliant, while the bell on the House door chimes a thin agreement as each signatory passes. Reputation rises like a fresh tide for you among the Union and the Pilots, and Kelvar grudges are tempered by respect for a deal that saved both face and silver, setting the stage for future mediations you can walk into with your oath-marker held high."

            "text": "You craft a face-saving mechanism for House Kelvar: an escrow chest funded jointly by Kelvar and the Twelve Seals that opens only if convoys fail due to clear harmonic disruption certified by the Collegium and the Order. You argue that this de-risks their ledgers without taxing the hungry, and that in return Kelvar will pledge a heat-levy cap for the season and a toll freeze during two named windows. You insist the Bell-Tongue remain at the threshold of the House all winter, to be rung before any claim on the escrow is considered, so fear cannot masquerade as fact. You invite Neris to formalize criteria for ‘harmonic disruption’ so that the mechanism cannot be gamed by rumor or by a clerk’s trembling hand. Your tone is conciliatory and deft, appealing to Kelvar’s love of instruments and the House’s devotion to bread, and you keep one hand on your copper ward-tile as if to anchor the room to something older than numbers.",
            "outcome": "Thane Kelvar’s eyes narrow as he calculates the optics and the safety of a chest he cannot open alone, and then he nods like a man who has found a way to be generous without losing. The escrow is agreed with a stringent witnessing protocol, and Mara, skeptical, accepts two windows with the promise that a third can be added if river levels hold. The heat-levy cap is hammered into the House ledger with a clause that any violation triggers automatic relief from Union stores at Kelvar’s cost, and the hall murmurs its approval. A few stevedores grumble that this smells like counting-hall cleverness, but Ina shields the pact with her authority and a public reading that makes the clauses sound like prayers. You leave with the oath-marker and strong Union favor, a wary but workable respect from Kelvar, and a quiet word from Neris that your name now carries weight in rooms where lenses float and numbers hum."

            "text": "You invite Neris Aline to present measured drift charts and propose a trigger clause tying toll stability and heat-levy caps to dual-confirmation: the Bell-Tongue’s chime and the Collegium oculus reading must both agree that harmonics have shifted beyond a stated threshold. You set forth that absent such agreement, all rates remain fixed during convoy windows, and that any unilateral change constitutes breach and automatic restitution to affected barge-crews. You argue that this removes caprice from both fear and greed, and that trusting two instruments—one civic, one scholarly—honors the city’s twin pillars of craft and knowledge. You further propose that the Pilots’ Covenant publish window charts three days in advance and that Kelvar publish toll postings in eel-skin at the River Market, so rumor cannot outrun ink. The House listens as the bell murmurs and the oculus lens on Neris’s chain glitters, and even skeptics feel the dignity of rules that bow to truth rather than to any one faction.",
            "outcome": "The clause is adopted with a solemnity that tastes like metal and rain, and the Order’s attending scribe taps the ward-stamp so hard that the copper sings. Kelvar, unable to argue against a test they helped to underwrite, accepts the freeze in principle, and the Pilots accept the public charting obligation with pride and a hint of mischief at being the river’s heralds. The heat-levy cap is inked with a reference to the same dual-confirmation, so it cannot be lifted in a panic unless the instruments truly cry danger, and steadholds in Murkwall bless your name. Some Union firebrands sulk that scholars shouldn’t wag a worker’s warmth, and Night Orchard whisperers note you’ve tied your work to devices others might learn to bend. Yet the city breathes easier, your standing with the Collegium rises like a lantern catching dusk-light, and the toll chains at the Ford hang with a new honesty that makes even tollmen stand a little straighter."

You plant the Bell-Tongue hard upon the dais and declare that until the Shard’s song steadies, the only just number is the one that keeps fires lit and barges moving. You call for a city watch on toll towers and threaten a rolling slowdown at the Foundry and the Chainbridge if Kelvar resists, knowing Mara can summon horns along the river in hours. You say the House of Reconciliation’s murals mean nothing if hands clasp only when it’s cheap, and that this hall was born from riots no one wishes to taste again. Your voice is iron and your eyes are river-black, and the hall rises to the heat of it, even as you feel the old ache of how quickly a crowd’s warmth tips toward flame.",
            "outcome": "The room erupts like a stoked kiln, and for a breath even Thane looks rattled as pilots thump oars on the floor and stevedores pound calloused fists. Kelvar yields on the heat-levy cap under the pressure of public shame and Ina’s implacable gaze, but refuses a full rollback, offering instead an immediate freeze and grain vouchers funded from clan reserves. Mara calls off the threat of a slowdown at your nod, and you accept the compromise with a warning that the river will remember who tightened chains in winter. The bell at the door tolls as people leave, some with hope, some with fire still in their throats, and the Order’s scribe gives you a look that says ‘twice more like this and we will come asking questions’. You win the oath-marker and the warmth of the Union’s regard, and though Kelvar’s welcome cools like quenched glass, the city sleeps that night with more braziers lit than would have been, and fewer knives seeking answers no one can afford."
