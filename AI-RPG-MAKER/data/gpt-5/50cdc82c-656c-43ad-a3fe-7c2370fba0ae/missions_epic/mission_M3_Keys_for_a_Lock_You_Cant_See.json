    "description": "Mist braided itself to the Chainbridge like a second set of chains, softening lantern halos into a drift of captive stars. The Shard breathed its blue dusk-light into the river skin, and the iron links thrummed with a music that might have been the city’s own pulse. Beneath the mid-span, where prismatic panels sometimes winked open for ritual inspections and secret councils, Jaryn Chainwake felt old guilt stir like a snagged root tugging at the ankle. He had once carried a parcel that was not what it claimed, and in that misdirection other hands had taken a ring of keys meant for a lock that no one in daylight ever admitted existed. Tonight, the game returned with higher stakes, for the lock was older than charters and hungrier than tolls, and there were fingers ready to turn it that stank of debt oaths and sanctified doctrine. House Kelvar’s guards kept watch from the toll towers with ledger-sharp eyes; the Order had posted a warden who wore piety like a weatherfront; and Garrin Chainwatch ran the mid-span like a helmsman who had lashed his heart to the centerline and dared storms to try him. The pivoting panel hid a ladder into a Shard collar cavity wide enough for quiet deals and loud betrayals, and far below all that space the Luthien pooled into a cold black listening where old metal could be heard singing to its own memory. Iven Shadequinch came out of the fog as if grown from it, a gardener without soil on his hands, carrying the shape of a task and the scent of consequences. What needed doing was simple in the way of a noose: move a decoy ring where it would be seen, draw eyes and blades to the wrong brightness, and buy the Night Orchard a handful of heartbeats to plant a countermeasure in a place that mattered. This was a dance upon an iron string while the river breathed beneath, and if the step faltered the city’s lights might dim in ways no lantern could mend.",

            "lines": "You and I shared a parcel once that wasn’t what it claimed, and the river remembers every misnamed thing more clearly than any ledger. That night bought this night, Jaryn, and though I wear no dirt I have soil under my tongue when I speak of debts, so I will not pretend innocence or surprise. There is a lock here older than the charters and hungrier than the tolls, a listening mouth of metal that was taught to keep councils honest and now tempts the faithless to shut them altogether. Keys were cut for it in shadowed rooms where sums outweigh oaths, and a hand dipped in debt and doctrine will reach tonight, sure that righteousness and arithmetic make the same music. Carry my decoy where it will be seen, let their hunger chase the glint and not the bite, and I will set the true teeth where they belong before anyone notices their bite is gone. I do this for the city’s canopy, not for coin, because when storms come it is the canopy that keeps us all from breaking, and there are those who would prune it to a single branch with their name on it. The chain will sing under you, the guards will bristle in their borrowed courage, and the Order’s warden will smell sacrilege on the mere idea of secrets, but your feet know the measure of crossings that matter. If you feel guilt tug, let it pull you forward, not down; some roots are there to keep the bank from sliding into the water."

            "lines": "No one dances mid-span without my say, not steersmen, not scholars with glass toys, not gardeners who talk like rain in winter. Toll tower eyes are on you, the chains are loaded like bows before a flood, and the panels under our boots are as trustworthy as a drunk promise when the river throws a shoulder. I have seen smugglers crawl under this deck like beetles in a cathedral and I have watched lovers whisper oaths that walked along the links to strangers fated to help them, and both sorts believe the bridge owes them a blessing. Give me a straight word, Jaryn Chainwake, because the river taught me to hate curves unless they are part of a bend you can see coming, and the Shard’s glow catches the lie on a man’s face more surely than any priest’s brand. If you lie, I will know it by the way your hand sits on your hook and by the way your shoulders hive up like a barge under bad ballast, and then I will blow a whistle that calls kelp-eyed bastards with ledgers and litanies. I owe House Kelvar nothing but the toll I pay with my breath and the Order nothing but the courtesy of a nod when their boots land true, so speak, and remember that my first vow is to keep the crossing open for those who cannot afford a delay."

            "lines": "Straight as a stretched towline, Garrin, because bent truth snaps at the worst moment and I have seen enough drowned cargo to learn. I am carrying a decoy to draw greedy eyes and dutiful suspicions, so the real trouble looks the wrong way and the true teeth can be set where they guard the city instead of gut it. If I let the wrong people set their bite into the right key, we will wake to find half the city sold to a number that cares nothing for flood-bells or bread-lines, and the other half arguing scripture while the chains rust. Stand with me or stand aside, but do not call a flood down while we are still crossing, because once the river decides for us it takes the choice out of all our hands for a long time. I will not name panels or ladders, and I will not spill Orchard sap in your ear, but I will swear on my ward-tile that no blood needs be shed for this crossing to do its work. Let me pass with enough noise to satisfy the watchers and enough grace to keep the bridge honest, and when I am done I will plant the decoy where only rats and rumors find it, then blink a prism code you can pretend you never saw. If anything goes sideways, I will take the blame on my back, the way a steersman takes the gust, and I will meet your eyes when it is done rather than vanish like fog after sunrise."

            "text": "You square your shoulders and meet Garrin’s weathered stare with the simple gravity of a pilot calling a course. You tell him just enough to honor his charge, naming danger without naming doors, and couch your request in the old river codes about crossings that protect the small and the hungry. You appeal to his first vow rather than to his pride, reminding him that closed passages starve the poor long before they inconvenience the mighty who can hire boats to go around. You make a show of the decoy ring, letting it clink against your bracer with a sound that carries to toll-tower ears, while keeping your body between the panel seam and any gaze that might learn too much. You promise no bloodshed and no broken planks, only a managed ruckus that will pass like a gust leaving the deck stronger for having been tested.",
            "outcome": "Garrin inhales like a bellows and lets the air out slow, then nods once and sets his men to a pattern of looking the wrong way at the right times, granting you a narrow window etched in their footwork. House Kelvar’s guards mark you as a braggart courier with a shiny burden, and their suspicion hardens like river ice, but they choose to track rather than tackle, giving you space to cross. The Order’s warden watches with a priest’s frown yet holds, perhaps because your oath on the ward-tile rang true to ears trained for such chimes, and a quiet calculation replaces outrage. You plant the decoy in the predetermined cache beneath a loose prism panel whose shadow looks like a harmless stain, and you pulse the prism-lamp code that says done, unseen, and dry. Iven’s shadow loosens from the fog and vanishes with the true teeth in hand, the Night Orchard’s favor settling around your shoulders like a cloak you can call on later, while the ledger-men’s suspicion ticks upward in a book you will feel soon enough."

            "text": "You snap the shutters of your prism-lamp in a rapid pattern that a dozen barge-crews once used to drill for high-water emergencies, and the bridge erupts in reflections that skitter like startled minnows. You swing your barge-hook halberd under the chain and strike a rhythm on iron that sounds alarm without naming its cause, drawing every watchful eye to luminous motion and disciplined noise. You vault a knee-high brace and stage a near-slip that would have sent a lesser riverborn to the drink, catching yourself at the last gasp and letting the toll tower gasp along with you. You bark commands in the Pilots’ cadence, and men respond to tone even if they don’t know the tune, which binds the crowd in motion you can steer like a current. In the swirl, you make the decoy’s glint appear, disappear, and reappear like a mischievous fish until no one is sure whether they saw anything at all, save that you are the center of the commotion and therefore the obvious target.",
            "outcome": "The spectacle works like a net, knot by knot, hauling attention where you cast it and away from the pivoting panel that yawns and shuts as if it were never there. House Kelvar’s guards blow whistles and commit faces to memory with the zeal of ledgers carving numbers, and your name inks a darker line in their quiet roster of problems to price. The Order’s warden strides in with ritual authority and gets swept by your cadence into directing a safety cordon, and in doing so unintentionally shields the panel from anyone who might have leaned too close. You slip the decoy into the cache as though palming a coin at a festival trick, then still your lamp and send the clean two-beat signal that says the plant is true and the river is quiet. When it all settles, Garrin drags you into the lee of a chain and growls that you still owe him a calm day after this storm you made, yet his eyes hold a battered amusement that says you did right by the crossing, and the Night Orchard’s favor quietly blossoms while Kelvar’s suspicion grows thorns."

            "text": "You choose silence over show, sliding to the bridge’s lip where rust seeds the bolts and the river breath speaks in damp syllables. You clip your harness to a ring no larger than a palm and roll under, the world turning upside down as lantern halos invert and the Shard’s glow becomes a cold sky at your feet. You move like a crane-hand on a high line, using the barge-hook to catch ribs and seams, pausing whenever the chain groans so your own breath will not be the only sound. Above, footsteps drum impatiently, and you count them the way pilots count teeth at the Chanting Ford, knowing which tones are names you must not answer. At the panel’s shadow you find the ladder mouth blind to any gaze that is not willing to lie flat and risk a splash, and there you ease the decoy into the cache with a gentleness that would not offend a sleeping god.",
            "outcome": "Your route keeps eyes from learning angles they should not know, and only a single guard leans down far enough to sense a change in the air that he cannot place. House Kelvar’s suspicion increases less from what they saw than from what they did not, and nothing chills an accountant like an unbalanced line he cannot reconcile, so the scrutiny grows in absence. The Order’s warden hears a faint metal hum from below that he later writes up as a test of wards that passed, because his doctrine has no room for a lock that is not under their seal, and so he pushes the discomfort into ritual paperwork. You rise, wipe the wet from your knuckles, and send the three-flick code to Iven that says the seed is in and the soil was quiet, then you blend to Garrin’s side with the calm of a man who never left the deck. Garrin eyes the damp on your sleeve, decides aloud to ignore the river’s old rumor that wet cuffs mean mischief, and lets you pass with a warning to bring him bread and a story later, while the Night Orchard’s favor tucks itself into your future and House Kelvar’s interest is a dark bird beginning to circle."
