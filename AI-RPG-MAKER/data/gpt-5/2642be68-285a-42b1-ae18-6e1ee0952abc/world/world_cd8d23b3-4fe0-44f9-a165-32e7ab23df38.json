    "city": "Thyssara, the City of Glass Reeds, rises in tiered shelves of prismstone where the River Aur breaks into canals and shines into the Shardmere. The city is latticed with footbridges, wind-stilled alleys, and reed-choked sluices; its quays ring with the soft song of tempered glass and the creak of rope as pilots edge barges between floodgates. Architecture favors stilted foundations with glassbrick facing that glows when the moth-lamps are lit; light is colored, pooled, and traded like spice. Districts braid around water and height: Molden Quays for hard labor and pilots; Gilded Sluice for mechanics and money; Windward Steps for militia and sky-skiffs; Candlecourt for law and scribes; Quiet Walks for monasteries and archives; Reedgate for harvesters and furnace-clans. \nThyssara was founded 317 years ago by river refugees following the Starfall War, anchored around an ancient Prism Spire that bends daylight for leagues. The city thrived on two miracles: the glassreeds of the Shardmere, whose silica-laced stalks smelt into singing glass, and the Tide-Engine that mastered the Aur's floods. The Tide-Engine was raised 142 years ago by the Tidewrights Consortium, bringing prosperity and a rigid schedule to river life. Sixty-three years ago the Red Flood tore through Molden Quays when an unvetted gearline jammed; the resulting riot burned half of Gilded Sluice. Last winter a bloom of white moths cocooned the Prism Spire, a phenomenon locals call the Moth Ascension; the Order of Moths says it was a warning from the night. \nLegends are cobbled into law and commerce. It is said the city's founders bargained with the Reedmother, a spirit of the lake, trading moonlight for safe harvests. The third bell at dawn is never rung on Flood-Binding Day, lest the drowned crown rise from the Shardmere to claim its tax. Some claim the Prism Spire is not a tower but the splinter of a fallen skybridge, with a mind of its own; when it hums in the heat, pilots lash their boats to stone and pray. \nThyssara depends on the Shardmere beds for glass, the upland Gallowhill mills for flour and gear grinding, saffron caravans across the Ember Dunes to perfume its trade and preserve its food, and the Salted Compact's pilots to thread storm and silt. The city's defense, water, and winter firewood all pivot on the Tide-Engine schedule. Its libraries and night faith hinge on the Order of Moths, who tend the silent gardens where memory-moths are bred. \nConflicts bite like cold reeds. The Guild of Glassreed Weavers resents the Tidewrights' fees for gate passage and seeks a new compact with the Reedmother to break dependence on floodworks. The Lantern Court, keepers of civic law, tries to rein in both without losing face to the Wardens of the Windward, whose skiffs and aeries hold the sky. The Smoulder Veil smuggles raw reed and illegal sootglass through the Obsidian Fen, undermining taxes and burning secrets in their ashmasks. The Salted Compact, pilots and dockfolk, flex their strength with strikes at the quays when squeezed by any of the above. Beyond the walls, star-born ruins tug at minds; within, the city's bells mark not only time but who holds it.",
