He grew up under the shadow of the Red Flood’s memorial rope and swore at fourteen never to let a gate take another friend. Drafted as a quay-guard and later trained at Windward Bastion under Sergeant Aren Mir, he became a boarding-shield on sky-skiffs and flood boats, escorting writs from the Hall of Lanterns and pilgrims of the Order of Moths alike. During a fog-thick turnover at the Tide-Engine House, Kade hauled a drowning Tidewright surveyor, Tomas Helwin, out of the thief’s gate whirl, and in the aftermath glimpsed diagrams of a hidden bypass that could drain Thyssara’s basins dry. When strikes pinched the quays and families went hungry, Jalen Sarq of the Smoulder Veil hired Kade to guard a sootglass run around the Obsidian Fen; he took the coin to keep food on his mother’s table and has hated the scent of burned tar ever since. After the Moth Ascension cocooned the Prism Spire, the Order contracted Kade to shield an echo-gathering at the Starfall Scar. There, in the bowl of fused night, an echo spoke his name backward and kept it. Now Kade walks a knife-edge between bells and smoke: too lawful for the Veil, too blunt for the Court, loyal to pilots, and sworn to keep the gates honest even if it means breaking ranks with old allies.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Glass-reed Sabre\",\n      \"description\": \"A curved reedblade forged from Shardmere glass threads quenched in mothwax.
