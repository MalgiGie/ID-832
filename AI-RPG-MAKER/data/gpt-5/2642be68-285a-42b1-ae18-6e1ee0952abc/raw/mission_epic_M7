The Archive of Unnamed Days has found a palimpsest that overlays Thyssara with the outline of an older, moth-shaped city, and the text slithers like a fish unless a true bell-chart pins it flat. Seler Daki, a scribe with ink in every groove of his hands and a memory that can tell rain by its consonants, believes the last abbot’s chart still sleeps in the cliffside cloister. The path to the cloister narrows to a knife where even the River Aur would refuse to flow, and the wind up there eats words until it turns them into music that lingers in the teeth. In the lower cells, frescoes of moths and bells keep vigil beside a broken organ pipe that exhales warm air and whispers of a market with no dawn, a commerce where time takes payment and returns change slowly, if at all. The sea sometimes shows itself from those heights as a blade of iron-blue, and the past shows itself there too, narrower than the path and twice as sharp. You will guide Seler through wind that knows names, resist the market’s soft invitations, outstep scavengers who sell history by the piece, and return with the chart before Thyssara’s bells forget who they are.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Seler Daki safely along the cliff roads to the Farsong Monastery Ruins, keeping his feet true where the stone pretends to be air.\",\n        \"Locate the abbot’s cell amid wind-scored cloisters and retrieve the original bell-chart that taught Farsong how to remember itself.\",\n        \"Resist the lure and bargaining whispers of the ‘market with no dawn’ that breathes behind the broken organ pipe without stepping across its threshold.\",\n        \"Evade or outwit scavengers combing the ruins and return with Seler by a safe cliff path before the evening gusts turn predatory.\",\n        \"Deliver the bell-chart intact to the Archive of Unnamed Days so the palimpsest will hold still and speak plainly.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Seler Daki\", \"lines\": \"The bell-chart is not merely lines and circles, Kade Orrel; it is a covenant written between stone and breath, a memory the wind agreed to keep. Our palimpsest writhes like a fish on a dock because it lacks that covenant, and my fingers ache with the way its letters try to flee. If we can bring the chart home, the old moth-shaped city will lie still long enough to confess what it is hiding beneath Thyssara’s streets. When the cliff path narrows, I will make myself smaller and let your back be my wall, and if the wind begins to pronounce my name, I ask you to drown it with rope and instruction. Do not let me answer the broken organ’s warm sigh; a market that denies dawn will count my days as coin, and I am too poor to pay with the hours I have left.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mira Cael\", \"lines\": \"Wardens of the Windward have thrown loops over those heights enough times to learn which stones lie and which merely brag, and I have marked two ledges where the cliff will not shrug you off. If the gust turns against you, whistle twice and a windline will drop; do not be proud, because pride is a way to measure the fall. I have seen those wind pipes sing when no one stands to breathe for them, and I do not trust music that writes itself. Take this token that answers my sky-kite code; even in fog or dusk it will tell me where to aim a rope and how to read your need. Bring the chart, bring your bones, and bring back the scribe with his tongue unspent, because the city needs all three more than it needs another ghost.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kade Orrel\", \"lines\": \"I have walked gates that ground lives to silt and I have listened to bells that told lies kindly, and I know the difference between a knot that holds and a knot that hopes. I will go first where the rock grows mean, and my rope will speak for you when the wind tries to bargain, and if it hums your name I will make it forget. We will find the abbot’s cell, fold the chart like a bird that remembers its nest, and leave that market to starve on its own promises. If scavengers step out with clever smiles and hanging lanterns, I will measure them by their hands before their words, and answer with Compact courtesy or Bastion steel as the day demands. Keep your breath for climbing and your silence for the Archive, Seler; I will keep the rest honest.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Abbess Rinna Sel\", \"lines\": \"When you stand before the broken organ pipe, remember that breath is a prayer the body makes without asking, and a market with no dawn would buy the prayer and leave the body bargaining. The House of Quiet Wings has seen such thresholds before, and those who stepped across found their names trailing them like leashes pulled by invisible hands. Take this candle whose wick remembers the tone of refusal; light it if the whispers grow soft and sweet, and it will teach your feet to turn without shame. Do not say the abbot’s name out loud in his cell, for the Scar keeps names now like a jealous ledger, and echoes walk far in these days. Bring back the chart, not a story about the chart, and do not trade your grief for a discount, because grief is the only honest price we can afford to pay.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ysil Kett\", \"lines\": \"You walk with Archive business in your eyes and Warden rope burns on your hands, stranger, and that tells me you carry something the cliff did not manage to steal. We take only what is already lost, that is our creed, but Farsong has been lost so long that everything here qualifies by our lights. A bell-chart would fetch a fine price in the Golden Quay, and even finer with the Veil who likes to make fresh laws by night where the bells cannot hear. I have no wish to bleed on these stairs, because blood makes the stone slick for everyone, but I will put you on your knees if you make me count to three. Speak a fair price in coin, promise, or path, and perhaps we all walk away with our throats untroubled and the wind free to sing about other fools.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pesha Lume\", \"lines\": \"When you bring the chart, bring the smell of it if you can, because dry parchment keeps the weather it slept beneath and the room it feared, and we will match its breath to our palimpsest like a chord to its root. The Hall of Unnumbered Calendars has a place waiting where days slide and catch, and the chart will pin our skittering text like a moth that volunteers to be read. Do not smooth its creases too eagerly, because bends in paper are footpaths in memory and we follow them with the respect owed to the dead. If the organ’s market sang to you, tell me nothing of its prices until the lamps are dim and the moths are calm, for some commerce bruises the air when named. You will have done a work of mercy if you have simply refused to buy what it was selling, and the city’s bells will be kinder for it.\"\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Trace the wind’s spine and keep to the stone\", \"text\": \"You follow Mira Cael’s markings and treat each ledge like a covenant rather than a shortcut, using your pilot’s rope as a moving handrail and setting Seler’s pace to the drumline of your breath. When the wind tries to name him, you name the knots faster, calling them by the old Compact numbers and teaching the gusts to count to ten and no further. At the organ’s mouth you plant your boots outside the threshold and speak to it like to a storm, acknowledging its hunger while offering no cargo, and you let its warm sigh pass over you as over granite. In the abbot’s cell you move like a guest who knows the host is dead but still listening, easing the bell-chart loose from beneath a stone that has been taught to lie still. On the way back, you read the cliff’s shadows as carefully as any signal banner, and you choose the stairs that smell of salt rather than those that smell of coin.\", \"outcome\": \"The wind relents and changes from a voice into a weather, and Seler stops listening as if answers were owed to air. A ledge crumbles under your heel and then decides against it because your rope tells it a different story, and you feel the city’s luck shift like a boat finding its channel. The organ’s warmth turns to plain breath against the candle’s silent flame, and the promise of the market fades like a rumor that never took root. In the abbot’s cell you find the chart intact, threaded with moth-gum along its edges, and a margin notation hums at the edge of hearing about how to quiet a palimpsest without burning it. You return with scraped knuckles and a clean conscience, and though scavengers shadow you, they find no argument that your pace and your empty pockets will entertain, so they let the city’s need outrun their greed.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Offer a refusal in wax at the market’s threshold\", \"text\": \"You stop at the broken organ pipe and set the Abbess’s remembrance candle where the warmth breathes, letting the wick drink a little of that air while your own lungs hold onto your name. Speaking no prices, you recite the Quiet Wing’s negation prayer in the pauses between gusts, treating every pause as a lock and every syllable as a key that refuses to turn. The whispers behind the pipe swell and soften, offering trades that sound like mercies, but you answer them with silence that has been taught its duty and a rope that knows which way is down. Seler closes his eyes and lays his palm on the stone, choosing the monastery’s patience over the market’s comfort, and the two of you take a long minute to let temptation pass like nausea. Only when the candle’s flame steadies and points toward the abbot’s cell do you move, stepping away as one steps away from a cliff’s edge in a story told to children who are meant to keep breathing.\", \"outcome\": \"The market’s warm exhalation cools into mere draft, and a hint of resin and mothwax rides it, a sign that the Quiet Wing’s refusal has been heard without offense. A thread of sound uncoils from deep within the ruined organ, not a lure but a direction, and it guides you toward a wall-stone that surrenders the chart with the gratitude of a patient dismissed. Seler’s face loses the strained brightness of someone who is almost sold, and he thanks you without voice, saving the thanks for the Archive where words are paid their due in order. The candle gutters as you leave, not from wind but from completion, and you pinch it out with two fingers so as not to promise it further work. No debt is incurred but vigilance, and vigilance is a debt you are willing to carry because it lightens rather than weighs; the path back opens like a door that recognizes good manners.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Parley with the cliff scavengers under Compact courtesy\", \"text\": \"When Ysil Kett and her pickers step from the fresco shadows with their lanterns hooded to a bargaining glow, you lower your sabre but not your guard and greet them by the Ropes and Knots Hall’s dock-etiquette. You name the bell-chart as civic salvage already sworn to the Archive, and you name yourself responsible for its safe return, putting your reputation where the law cannot reach. You offer them a safer descent path marked by Warden code, a whisper of an untouched kiln-stair on the south face, and a writ-tokened promise of first look at any legal work moving through the Quiet Walks that needs hands without questions. You speak to their hunger like to a neighbor’s thirst, acknowledging it as honest but refusing to turn the well into a private cup, and you remind them that blood on the stairs makes a poor profit. When their hands loosen, you share dried saffron bread and the story of one gate opening too fast, and between bites and the weather the edge of the moment dulls to something that need not cut.\", \"outcome\": \"Ysil Kett decides that a clean corridor is worth more than a noisy quarrel, and she counts your offers not as coin but as routes to future coin, which is the better arithmetic. The scavengers pocket their hooks without making you bleed for the privilege, and they melt back into the mural’s moth-swarmed gloom, leaving a small cairn to warn you of a loose stair three turns ahead. Your promise becomes a cord around your wrist that you can feel when you sleep, a new knot among the others, but it sits light because it was tied in daylight. Seler breathes easier and does not meet your eye until his cheeks have learned not to show relief, and then he nods as if to admit that talking can be a weapon when a blade would be a mistake. The city will remember that the chart reached the Archive without a fight, and the city’s memory is a market that actually opens every dawn, which is the sort worth investing in.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M6\"], \"next\": [\"M8\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"faction favor\", \"description\": \"Order of Moths favor (major): formal permission to consult the Hall of Unnumbered Calendars and its shifting dates without a chaperone.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"A windline token from Mira Cael, tuned to Warden sky-kite code; when shown or sounded, it signals emergency aerial extraction to friendly skiffs.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"insight\", \"description\": \"Understanding that the palimpsest, once steadied by the bell-chart, marks a lightwell widening beneath the Prism Spire, a danger pressing closer each new moon.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
