A harvest barge slipped off the bells and into the moonless dark of the Shardmere, its song cut short and its lanterns found nowhere along the regular channels, and every quay in Molden Quays has added fresh knots to the memorial rope. Inspector Daru Fenlik, red-eyed from soot-lamps and watching over a courthouse river of mosaic stone, presses a sealed writ into your palm with a weight that feels like a promise and a threat, and a waxed packet of sketches mapped in a nervous hand shows a cove where the reeds themselves are said to sing in black-glass tones that crack the air. The Prism Spire is still cocoonsilver from last winter’s Moth Ascension, and the Order of Moths murmur that night gave a warning; the Tidewrights count gears and blame smugglers, while the Guild of Glassreed Weavers whisper about sabotage and secret compacts with a river spirit who knots channels when angered. Daru wants lanterns, ledgers, and route tokens hauled from the reeds, not stories, and he wants them delivered to the House of Quiet Wings where mothwax will taste the soot and say whether fear or calculation fed the flame, and he wants it soon, before the bells are forced to speak louder than the law. You will need a pilot who reads knots by feel and can ask permission of water without saying the word, and Nelai Pruen waits by a skiff with oars wrapped in mothcloth, eyes on the reeds as if the green-blue stalks might answer back when you step aboard.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Daru Fenlik at the Hall of Lanterns and receive the writ of inquiry.\",\n        \"Travel with Nelai Pruen to the Shardmere cove marked in the sketches.\",\n        \"Recover the barge’s burned lanterns and any route tokens or ledgers.\",\n        \"Deliver the items to the House of Quiet Wings for mothwax testing.\",\n        \"Report preliminary findings to Daru Fenlik in Candlecourt.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Daru Fenlik\", \"lines\": \"You still carry the smell of the quays, Orrel, and that is why I asked for you, because the quays do not lie to their own. The Court needs eyes that don’t blink when reeds start to sing or when a pilot curses the bells, and I will not send a clerk with ink on their fingers to drown under a polite tide. Don’t mistake my manners for friendship, because friendship is a coin I cannot spend while the city listens for the third bell and wonders if it means flood or fire. I have a stack of writs ready for the day rumor outpaces law and turns into riot, and I will sign them without a tremor if I must, and I would prefer not to use your name among them if you bring me what I ask. Bring me lanterns, not stories; bring me ledgers and route tokens that fit the teeth of our laws, and if the Veil has a hand on this rope I want to feel it burn through the leather and leave a mark I can show to the Hall without flinching.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kade Orrel\", \"lines\": \"I grew up counting those lanterns on the way to dawn shifts, Daru, and I remember which ones hummed low when winter closed its fist, and which ones went out before the bell because a child fell asleep on watch. When they go dark, people stop eating and start carrying knives, and I have seen too many hands shake around a blade because they were hungry and scared and tired of schedules they never wrote. I will find what burned and who bent the tongue of the flame, and I will lay it on your mosaic river so you can point a finger without guessing and without needing to drown the low alleys in warrants to seem strong. But I will not twist a pilot’s tongue for the comfort of a ledger, and I will not call a storm a crime because it arrived on a night you did not expect. If there is a knot tied by the Reedmother or by men in ash masks, I will show you the knot and the hands that tied it, and I will expect you to have the courage to name them without making the rest of us pay the price.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nelai Pruen\", \"lines\": \"You tie your knots like a Windward graduate, neat as a bell-clerk, and that is a fine way to drown because neat knots slip when the reeds sing sideways. In the reeds you tie for feel and for apology, not for show, and you listen with your fingers to the oar the way a mother listens to a sleeping child’s breath. The cove we are headed to hums wrong in a south wind and hums almost right in a north, and the fish turn to glass when you stare too long because they mirror what they fear, and lately everything fears the dark. If the Reedmother knotted those channels to keep fools out, we will ask permission with our oars and go in on the hush, and if men tied the knot instead I will hear the scrape of iron teeth in the water and we will cut it. Keep your blade sheathed until the reeds stop talking, keep your breath slow so your lantern does not taste of panic, and keep your promises because the water remembers every broken one as if it were a name.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pesha Lume\", \"lines\": \"Bring any soot you find to our moths without letting it taste open flame, because a second fire teaches soot to lie about its first hunger. Soot remembers the last breath that fed it, and in stillness, under our panes and in the presence of patient wings, it will tell us whether it tasted fear, oil, river breath, or calculation shaved thin as a clerk’s smile. The House will speak softly in return, as we always do, but do not confuse softness for silence or for surrender, because the night has laws that are older than bells and we are obliged to keep them even when day scowls. If the black-glass reeds sang a cracking note, we will know whether the song was their own or a pitch forced upon them by a kiln’s shadow and a debt’s shadow, and we will decide, with the Court if they are brave and without them if they are busy, how to mend the rip. Remember that last winter the Prism Spire wore a cocoon and the city called it the Moth Ascension, and we read it as warning, and warnings do not end when clerks close their ledgers; they end when the right hands, with the right gentleness, turn the right key in the right lock at the right hour.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Raise the Law’s Light\", \"text\": \"March openly under the writ with its brass token showing and the Lantern Court seal catching the dawn, and let the Wardens hear your boot on the dry-bridge so they know you are not skulking. Ask Nelai to signal with the union whistles in the knotwork so pilots understand this is not a raid but a rescue, and let the skiff run straight where others would weave. Stop at the Windward Bastion for a drumline note and borrow a signal kite, because if the reeds close and you vanish, someone should know which way you went and when. Insist on logging your departure at the Ropes and Knots Hall, so even the Salted Compact cannot say you went behind their back, and demand a pilot’s blessing rope be added to your skiff’s prow before you cast off. When you reach the marked cove, sound a legal bell once and only once, hold the writ high, and speak the charges aloud to the reeds as if they could read, because in Thyssara the world listens when the law chooses to be brave instead of loud.\", \"outcome\": \"The skiff cuts a straight wake and the Wardens on a high parapet nod, because the tokens and the bell speak for you even if some faces scowl at your boldness, and Nelai’s careful oar-strokes keep the prow from kissing any wrong channel. Pilots on nearby barges lower their knives and return to their ropes because they see a rescue, not a dragnet, and a few even point you along a path that is not on the Tidewright charts but is on the Compact’s palms. In the cove the reeds shiver as the bell-note settles, and behind a veiled comb of stalks you find two lanterns tangled in a mesh of black-glass threads like hair that has learned to cut, the wicks burned cold and oddly clean. The route tokens are wedged in a split in the gunwale nearby, and a ledger half-chewed by mineral water whispers its ink back when dried over mothwax, enough that Pesha Lume later reads margins about a ‘forbidden cove’ and ‘cracking song’. When you bring the items to the House of Quiet Wings, the soot under glass tells a patient tale of oil thinned with a binder used in legal furnaces but altered with something river-bitter, and the Order notes Wardens’ cooperation while the Compact’s respect warms by a degree; Daru receives your preliminary findings without sharpening his quill for warrants, though he does ask pointedly who adjusted the furnace binder and whether a guild ledger will bear that name.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Slip Beneath the Veil\", \"text\": \"Pocket the writ and keep the token in your sleeve where its edge can be felt but not seen, and ask Nelai to drift the skiff like a stray thought between leaf-shadows. Call in the old debt with Jalen Sarq and barter for a fog-signal and two ash-smudged oar-wraps, so anyone who sees you reads underquay business and not a court errand. Thread the tunnels under the old quays at dusk and surface beyond the last Warden drumline, listening for the soft cough of a Veil boat that keeps no wake. Speak with as few words as possible and pay with a favor rather than coin, because favors are quieter, and leave no chalk marks where a clerk could find them. When you reach the cove, slide in without a bell, with lantern hooded and breath slow, and let the reeds brush the hull like a pen across a page that does not wish to be written by day.\", \"outcome\": \"The night accepts you the way it accepts a secret it intends to keep, and Jalen’s runners make sure no Warden skiff pretends surprise at your shadow; in return he expects your eyes if you see a rival mask among the reeds. You find the lanterns fast because someone else already found them first and then tucked them back out of sight like a guilty hand returning a borrowed blade; the wicks bear a trace of sootglass binder that tastes of tar and debt when Pesha later tests it. A waterlogged ledger is hidden in a reed-knot that only a Compact hand would trust, and Nelai’s fingers coax it free without breaking the apology the knot is trying to make to the water. You also find a slipped coil of fuse twine snagged on a stalk, a thin line that only burns underwater if it has been soaked in a particular oil the Smoulder Veil favors, and that scrap flutters in your pocket like a moth that refuses to die. When you report to Daru, you tell the story in careful pieces that do not set the quays on fire, and he knows you held back a name or two and lets it pass this once because the Order’s soot-reading matches your tale; the Compact nods in grim gratitude while the Veil smiles with too many teeth, and the Wardens mark your file with both suspicion and respect.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Ask the Reedmother’s Leave\", \"text\": \"Treat the cove like a shrine, not a crime scene, and ask Nelai to choose the knots by feel and memory rather than by book, because books do not float here, they sink. Move at the slack between bells when even gears rest their teeth and offer the river a coil of clean rope and a handful of saffron grains, because the founders once traded moonlight for safe harvests and good bargains do not rot. Speak aloud your name and the barge’s name if you know it, and then fall quiet and let the hull’s ribs answer for you, because boats are truer mouths in the Shardmere. Let the skiff spin once with the current if the reeds tug, and do not fight the spin; accept it as an answer until the spin stops and points. Drift into the cove on the hush, with the lantern unlit and covered, and listen for the cracking song not as danger but as a warning bell that keeps you honest.\", \"outcome\": \"The channels comb themselves against your bow like fingers in hair and then loosen, and a narrow pass opens that was not on any chart, not even in the Compact’s chalk, and you glide into a bowl of water so still it seems to think. The lanterns hang from a braid of living reeds that has swallowed their frames but not their light-cups, and when Nelai hums a pilot’s apology under her breath the braid loosens as if a knot in a long marriage has been forgiven. The wicks are burned to a pearl ash that tastes, under Pesha’s moth-glass, not of tar or of furnace but of a bitter sap the black reeds exude when frightened, and the ledger you recover is wrapped in a sleeve of reed-pith that has not decayed because someone or something wanted the words to endure until the right hands came. The reed-braid leaves a green stain on your wrist that fades by Candlecourt but not before you notice it throbs in time with the quiet hum the Prism Spire sometimes keeps at noon, and it gives you a headache that feels like a name said backward. When you report back, Daru listens without rolling his eyes at talk of leaves and debts to water because the Order’s testing agrees with the tale, and the Weavers’ whispers sharpen as they recognize the scent of their own black cultivars; the Wardens shrug because the sky does not argue with lakes, and the Compact carefully files the path you took as a thing to try only on sliver moons.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"coin\", \"description\": \"Lantern Court stipend, a modest purse of clean-minted coin paid upon submission of preliminary findings to Candlecourt.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"writ\", \"description\": \"Temporary Investigator’s Writ, granting leniency and right-of-question at quays and reedbeds for the next mission’s duration.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"favor\", \"description\": \"Order of Moths favor (minor): one private consultation within the Listening Cloister to parse echoes, names, or soot-memory.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
