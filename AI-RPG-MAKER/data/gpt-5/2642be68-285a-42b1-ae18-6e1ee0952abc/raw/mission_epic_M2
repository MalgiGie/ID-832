Those ashes are a message and a dare, and Pesha Lume hears both as she sets her lamp, unlit, upon the Prism Citadel’s stone and asks you to bear her past the wind-chipped rim of the Starfall Scar. The Scar’s fused bowl glows faintly under a sickle of moon, breathing as if something sleeps beneath the glass and dreams in reversed voices, and the Wardens’ windline hums north to south like taut string over a drum. Two moth-keepers, Mira Cael and Lysa Curren, shoulder lacquered cases packed with wax, pale nets, and jars whose mouths are sealed with prayers, and they tread as if each step should not disturb the old sky-city buried in sand. Pesha says the lightwell opens every new moon like a lip to sip from the night, and the Order will seal it before it can widen to a thirst; she says your name, spoken backward there once, has made you a favored shield against echo-echoes. Your task is to ferry them across the Scar’s ribs, hold a silent perimeter while their moths drink dangerous light, and, when an echo inevitably leans close, catch it in a jar without letting it purchase your true name. Intruders will come for light, for lore, or for leverage, and some will carry bells that are not lawful; you will bar them with rope, blade, and quiet resolve. When the rite is done, your boots will carry the dust of a dead sky-city and the hush of something that almost woke, back through the canals to the House of Quiet Wings, where the Archive will weigh what you have taken and what you have left behind.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Pesha Lume’s team safely to the Starfall Scar’s central bowl.\",\n        \"Defend the rite from intruders attracted by the lightwell.\",\n        \"Hold a perimeter in silence while moth-keepers seal the opening.\",\n        \"Capture one echo in a mothwax jar without letting it speak your true name.\",\n        \"Return with Pesha to the House of Quiet Wings and report to the Archive.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pesha Lume\", \"lines\": \"The Scar remembers what we forget, and it forgets what we cling to, like a ledger that erases grief and keeps debt. If an echo offers you comfort, it is reaching for your spine, and comfort is the oldest knife in the dark. We will speak only in agreed signs once we cross the bowl, because the Scar loves the shapes of names and will bend toward them as reeds bend to wind. You will not answer to your name if it is sung, whistled, abraded in the glass, or braided in a friend’s mouth, because the thing that speaks it may never have had a mouth at all. You have already traded one syllable to this place, and the Scar keeps bargains, so I will not let it tax you twice even if I must spend my own breath to cover yours.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kade Orrel\", \"lines\": \"The first time I stood in that bowl the world felt like a bell that had just been struck, and the strike rang in my bones long after my ears went dull. My breath came back wrong and my fear felt like someone else’s memory, as if I had borrowed panic and returned it chipped. I can carry a shield and keep my mouth shut, and my rope knows the Scar’s edges better than most skiffs know their own cleats. But if something wears my voice, I want you to promise you’ll break the jar rather than let it walk home with us, because I would rather lose a weapon than come back with a thief in my lungs. I have hauled friends from the thief’s gate and cut knots that should never have been tied, and I will do both again before I let a bad light learn my name.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kara Dusk\", \"lines\": \"Wardens are running a windline above the Scar tonight, and not all of them trust moth rites that do not file itineraries with the Hall of Lanterns, no matter how much wax you carry. If anything drops from our skiffs that isn’t rain, I’ll be there to cut it from your spine, and I have a knife for rope and another for lies. I remember you from Bastion drills; you never dropped the hook when the rope bit, and I’ll take that over a prayer because prayers do not hold when the wind turns spiteful. If you need a sky-shade from our kites or a pulse from the drumline to scatter gawkers, raise your hand in the sign we taught you and keep your throat closed. The Scar hates metal less than it hates arrogance, so do not swagger, warrior, and I will not have to fish you out like a drowned bell.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mira Cael\", \"lines\": \"The moths I carry were raised on silent milk and fed the dust of old calendars, so they will drink only what the night owes and leave the rest to sleep. When the lightwell opens it will not roar; it will sigh like a door you always meant to fix and never did, and that is when hands move toward latches that should be left alone. I will set three nets, each woven with a name we no longer speak, and the names will snag what tries to slip past because names are hooks as much as words. Your task, Kade, is to hold the circle wide while we work narrow, because a rite fails when the world collapses onto it like a roof. If your heart begins to beat out of measure, press the mothwax to your tongue and remember a winter without bells, and the excess will pass like a bad tide.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lysa Curren\", \"lines\": \"I keep the jars and count the breaths, and I have learned that sometimes the difference between a sealed light and a stolen one is the length of a held exhale. Do not think me cold if I do not look up when you fight; the wax must cool at a pace set by the Scar’s own pulse or it will crack and spill. Intruders will come with curiosity, with greed, or with the courage of fools, and each demands a different silence, so measure your quiet like a surgeon measures thread. If an echo slides along your blade and reaches for your ear, tilt your head to the wind and let the Wardens’ line sing through you, because their hum can scatter the smallest of the hungry things. When we are done, I will press the warm seal with my thumb, and you will smell honey where there is none, and you will know that the mouth of the night has closed for now.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pesha Lume\", \"lines\": \"When the lightwell closes, there will be a moment when all sounds seem further away, like children stepping back from a game because the rules changed. Do not mistake that for safety, because the dark rearranges itself like a sleeper rolling over, and sleepers sometimes reach blindly for warmth and find a throat. We will leave a moth to watch our backs; it will die for us if asked, and we will add its name to the wax, because our order keeps accounts even when our eyes do not. If you must choose between a stranger’s lantern and the jar in your hand, choose the jar, because we can relight a lantern but we cannot unsay a name once the Scar has pocketed it. Walk beside me until speech becomes a weight we cannot afford, and then shoulder that weight with your silence and let me spend the rest.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Walk the Scar in Severed Silence\", \"text\": \"You vow to use only hand-signs and drum-taps on the rope, and you bind your wrist with a strip of mothcloth that tickles when your throat tries to rise. You brief Mira and Lysa on perimeter signals, scratch a map into the sand with your boarding hook, and mark four glass ribs with chalk to show fallback points if the night bucks. You signal Kara Dusk overhead with a low sweep that reads hold your height, and she answers with a kite tilt that means I see you but you do not see me. When the windline hums like a saw through ice, you raise a palm and the team closes ranks without a word, and you feel the Scar testing the quiet like fingers pressing for a bruise. In the bowl, when an echo scuffs your boot with a copy of your own step, you do not flinch or answer; instead, you set the jar and guide the cold breath into it as if cradling a coal too hot to hold.\", \"outcome\": \"The rite completes with the hush of a page turned in a holy book, and the moths drink until their wings pearl with dim light that fades into safe gray. Intruders from the ridge, a trio of scavengers with a star-etched shard, drift near but lose heart when your ring of silence does not break, and they retreat muttering about law-bells that never ring. The captured echo rattles the wax but does not learn your name, and Lysa’s seal holds without a crack, leaving a thumbprint you will swear is smiling. Pesha nods once, the gesture a quiet oath in itself, and promises your silence will be remembered in the House of Quiet Wings, where memory is counted like coin. Kara’s skiff shadows you on the walk out, and no one speaks until the canals take your footsteps and return them dull and harmless.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Parley the Windline\", \"text\": \"You choose to climb a shard-shelf and flash the Wardens’ short-code with your rope, spelling out rite in progress, hold line, no lanterns, and you risk the Scar’s attention to buy space from the sky. You speak briefly before the bowl, using words like blunt tools, telling Kara that the Order has a writ in spirit if not in ink, and that quiet will keep both city and skiffs safe tonight. You admit your history with the Bastion and trust your name to carry weight where your token does not, and the admission costs you a tremor in your gut when the Scar leans toward the sound. Back below, you brief Pesha on the adjustment and you widen the perimeter to account for a cautious aerial drift that might dislodge glass snow. When the lightwell opens like a thin mouth, you hold still and feel the windline shift overhead, braced for a collision of orders that does not come.\", \"outcome\": \"Kara Dusk slows the windline, keeps her crew above the bowl’s breath, and rides the thermals as if balancing a coin on the edge of a blade, granting you a dome of relative stillness. A Warden recruit drops a bolt by accident, but your warning tap on the rope makes Mira pause just long enough for the clatter to pass like a distant argument, and nothing breaks. Two Tidewright surveyors perched on the rim grumble about permits, but the Wardens’ presence and your raised palm settle them into watchers instead of meddlers. The echo you net is thin and brittle, the sound of a rumor rather than a name, and it hardens under wax without struggle. The Wardens owe you a quiet, and in return, Kara slips you a hush-sigil stamped with a salt-white flame, with a muttered reminder to file your rites next time with someone who likes you.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Set the Thief’s Circle\", \"text\": \"You lay a decoy lantern and a looped rope beyond the proper perimeter, building a thief’s circle that catches curious feet where you can deal with them away from the rite’s heart. You scatter buoy-stones painted ash-black in a pattern that only a pilot would read as danger, and you weight the rope with a knotted memory of the Red Flood so it tugs any trespasser low. You tell Mira and Lysa to ignore any noise from the decoy unless you signal twice, and you promise Pesha you will spend your blood in the circle before you let a hand reach the moth-nets. A pair of silhouettes slink down the ridge with ashmasks and a hunger for illicit glasslight, and you greet them with the quiet courtesy of a man who knows the Underquay too well. When one intruder whispers your name wrong, adding a syllable he could not have guessed, you know the Scar has kissed his ear, and you tighten the loop without a word.\", \"outcome\": \"The Smoulder Veil pair end up face-down in the dust with their pride bruised more than their necks, and you bind them to a glass rib with a knot that even shame cannot wriggle free of. Your decoy circle keeps the rite’s edge untouched, and the intruders’ dropped pouch yields a shard of mirrorglass that hisses when you breathe on it, which Pesha pockets with a frown that promises later questions. The real perimeter holds, the moths drink, and the lightwell closes on schedule with a sigh like tired stone, leaving only the smell of cold honey. The echo you capture spits once and goes still in the jar, and when it tries to lie about your name, the wax blisters but does not break, and your ear burns for a bell and then cools. When you cut the Veil loose at dawn you send them away unmarked by law but marked by fear, and word spreads that the Scar pays poor wages to thieves this season.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Study the Echo’s Teeth\", \"text\": \"You decide to let the echo brush your blade and breathe once against your cheek so you can learn its rhythm and set the jar in time, gambling that knowledge will buy safety for many rites to come. You warn Pesha with two fingers over your heart, a sign for calculated danger, and she tightens her lamp straps and mouths no even as she nods yes because she trusts your stubborn skill. You lower your breathing until your ribs creak like oars in slow water, and you angle the mothwax jar so its mouth is where your name would be if you spoke. When the echo hums a lullaby you have not heard since you were small and the Scar was still a story, you feel your throat move and you clamp it shut with teeth and will. You step through the note as if stepping through a looped rope, and you coax the sound into glass the way a pilot coaxes a barge through a gate with inches of mercy to spare.\", \"outcome\": \"The jar takes the echo and shakes like a sparrow in a winter hand, and the wax ripples with letters that are almost your name and then are not, and then they harden into harmless curls. Pesha’s relief is a brief storm that passes into lecture, and she says you have bought the Order a chart of the echo’s habit that will ease the sealing of three more wells, while also spending years you did not have permission to spend. Your head rings for an hour and the world looks slightly to the left of where it should, but by the time the lightwell closes the tilt has become a story you can carry. Mira notes the exact pitch that tempted you and smears a mark on her sleeve that will become a new pattern in the moth-nets, and Lysa adds a new thumb-press to the wax that means warned by courage. The Wardens watching from the windline write a line in their log about a warrior who listened to a ghost and did not answer, and Captain Aramus will read it and frown and remember your steadiness the next time your name crosses his desk.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M1\"], \"next\": [\"M3\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Mothwax-Sealed Memory Jar strengthened (reduces the grip of echoes)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Favor\", \"description\": \"Order of Moths favor (standard): access to Archive scribe-pools for one research session\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Permit\", \"description\": \"A hush-sigil that lets you pass one Warden checkpoint at night without a lantern\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
