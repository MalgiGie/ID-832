Mavek Dross met you at the mill-yard among sacks of grain and gear-grease, his voice the rasp of oiled timber as he spoke of drift and leverage, of schedules that could be mastered if an old shaft were coaxed awake. He needed a blade he could call an independent eye, a name he could point to when the bells demanded blame, and so he pressed a brass pass into your palm and sent you below where daylight died. The locals marked the time by the Headless Miller, a fog-walker who straightened ropes and unknotted nooses, and even the most practical millhands nodded to a headless shadow when the wind moaned in the vane. In the damp stone tunnels a low hum threaded through the bones of the hill, not sound but pressure, the taste of storm iron under the tongue, and fresh chalk sigils winked from the brick like the very numbers your friend Tomas once scrawled in secret. You knew the flavor of such marks: not the language of safety but the grammar of a lever, and if this lever were thrown in the wrong hour, the city’s basins might wake to the scrape of their own bones. The shafts narrowed, the walls sweated, and your steps counted like verdicts; you would have to decide what truth to carry up to Dross, what lies to cut free, and which path to mark for a return that might come at a run.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Travel to the Gallowhill Windmills and descend into the hidden undercroft beneath the turning arms.\",\n        \"Survey the bricked transmission shaft and document any fresh work without disturbing the structure.\",\n        \"Compare any marks you find against Tomas Helwin’s bypass sketches to confirm intent and alignment.\",\n        \"Decide whether to report all findings to Mavek Dross or to deliberately redact details that could be abused.\",\n        \"Mark safe ingress and egress routes through the undercroft in case later operation or extraction is needed.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mavek Dross\", \"lines\": \"Men like to talk about ghosts when their hands shake, and hills make cowards think of stories, but mills turn on teeth and temper, not on superstitions. I prefer measurements and walls I can kick, and I have kicked these walls until my heel remembers them better than my own bed. You will go down there and tell me whether I can trust old bricks to stay in their lane, whether the hill’s old bones will take a gear without grinding us into meal. If you find a lie laid in mortar, write its name on your report and I will grind it to dust with the rest, and I will pay you to be angry in precise language I can staple to a bell. Bring me what is true, not what is pleasant, and do not dress your fear in folk tales to sell me caution at a markup.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kade Orrel\", \"lines\": \"I have heard the hill breathe, Dross, and I know the sound of a shaft that wants to turn the way I know the sour cough of a river that wants to drown, and both sounds make my knuckles tighten. If you are grafting the hill to the Engine to shave bells, say it plain, because a shaved bell is sometimes a severed hand where I grew up. I will walk your dark and count your bolts, and I will mark the safe lines so a steward can run them without bleeding, and I will draw a map that does not lie. But if I find a path that leads straight to a dry basin and a city of mud-slick stairs, you will hear my boots on the Court’s floor before you hear them on yours, and I will set my rope on their oath-well and speak until the bells blister. I do not care whose name is on the lever if it empties Thyssara; I care whose wrist I must break to keep it steady.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kara Dusk\", \"lines\": \"We have had pilots tumble off mill-walks in fog when the ropes were cut neat, not frayed, and the neatness tells me a knife was there before the wind. You tell Dross he has more enemies than weather and gossip, because there are men who would sell five minutes of advantage for a season of regret. I will keep a skiff at the base in case you need to ride a downdraft to the river, and my crew will watch the vane shadows for signals if you knock the pattern we taught you. Do not go counting on the Headless Miller to set your knots, because he helps those who do not mock him and trips those who do, and even a friendly ghost will not catch a man who thinks himself cleverer than an old hill. If you start to feel the floor hum in your teeth, that is not a story; that is your last chance to leave before the hill takes your name and files it under accidents.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Tomas Helwin\", \"lines\": \"Those chalk marks, Kade, those are my numbers, twisted by a hand that envies precision and admires the way a lever can turn a city with the strength of a child. Someone took our safety margins and turned them into a pry bar, chiseling the stone where we left a cushion, and that is how you make a river obey until the day it remembers it is a river. If you hand Mavek the whole truth he will build a shrine to its usefulness, and he will garland it with promises and schedules until the garland is a noose. If you hand him half, he will fill the gap with concrete and call it faith, and sometimes faith in concrete is more dangerous than faith in saints. Mark your exits, fix your knot-lines low, and if you must betray me to save the city then do it with your eyes open and your report ready to be sworn under the bells.\"\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Name the Breath: Report every detail to Mavek Dross\", \"text\": \"You climb from the undercroft damp with brick-sweat and bring the full ledger of truth to Dross without lacquer or veil. You unfold Tomas’s numbers beside the fresh chalk, show the pattern of leverage and the way a bypass could drink the basins like a thirsty god, and you do not spare him the flavor of the risk. You trace your marked egress routes and note the guard stones that groan when weight shifts, grooming the map like a pilot preparing harbor lines for storm. You speak of the Headless Miller only as a proverb for humility, not as a plea for superstition, and you tell Mavek what bolts must be replaced before a child’s foot falls through them. When you finish, your throat is raw and your palm smells of chalk and fear, and you watch his eyes as they count both cost and opportunity.\", \"outcome\": \"Dross listens like a man measuring flood on a gauge-board and thanks you with a foreman’s handshake that sets your bruises singing, and he orders immediate locks on the undercroft with Tidewright seals. He promises to fold your safety margins into an official plan and to anchor your egress marks with steward rope, but you catch the quicksilver flicker of ambition in him when he says schedule, and you know your report will become a tool in more hands than his. Word runs fast to Gallowhill’s crew that a blunt-eyed warrior with a pilot’s rope has made the hill’s old bones speak, and respect and resentment trail you like wake foam. Kara’s skiff shadows the mill ridge for a bell, ready to pluck you if a reaction goes hot, but no siren cries; instead, the Wardens file a note to the Court that the Tidewrights have an independent survey. The city gains a cautious chance at safer gears, and you gain coin and chalk and a map whose lines other engineers will now learn by heart, but somewhere in the hill a hum resolves like a throat clearing before a proclamation.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Bank the Spark: Redact the lever and bury the bait\", \"text\": \"You return with a measured report that weighs stone and rust and the chewing tooth of time but leaves the true hinge of the bypass in the dark like a coal banked under ash. You record the fresh work as suspicious and cite the need for a closed audit, yet you describe the chalk marks in a way that suggests mischief rather than mastery. You share the exact danger only with Kara in a low-voiced confession under the turning arms, and you ask her to keep a skiff and a squad on a dusk-watch while you seed decoy marks that would break a thief’s diagram if copied. You send a whisper to Tomas that his numbers have been seen by hungry eyes and that his name will not be in the first report if he keeps his head below the vane. You mark your exits twice as clearly and you scatter a few notes that would make an impatient saboteur trip, because even a clever knife can be dulled by a careful sheath.\", \"outcome\": \"Dross takes your report and narrows his eyes like a man tasting grain that may be weevil-bit, and he pays you without complaint but the weight of his coin feels like a scale that will remember you. He locks the undercroft and orders an internal crew to begin cleaning the brick-face, while your decoy marks quietly guide them toward innocuous dead ends and caution rather than speed. Kara stations a skiff in a shadowed cove and drills her crew on your egress marks, promising to cut signal ropes if the hill thrums wrong, and she lays a watchword in your palm that can buy you a lift in any storm. Tomas breathes easier and sends you a coil of his own chalk codes with a note that says use these to confuse the greedy, and you use them well. For now the city is spared a too-quick marriage between hill and Engine, and though Dross’s suspicion may follow you, so too will a rumor that you know how to make danger stub its toe on its own ambition.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Split the Ledger: Two reports for two bells\", \"text\": \"You prepare two truths and send them ringing down different corridors, because sometimes a city must be saved by making its factions trip over each other in daylight. To Dross you deliver a clean, workmanlike account of stone condition, old shaft geometry, and your carefully drawn exits, and you frame the chalk as evidence of tampering that requires restraint. To the Lantern Court you bear a sealed addendum sworn at the Oath-well, naming the bypass pattern and its potential to drain the basins, and you ask for a provisional injunction that would slow any reconnection until the bells debate it. You deliver a third whisper to the House of Quiet Wings, requesting a night of watchful mothlight in the undercroft, because sometimes the dark sees more than any gauge. You know that by morning you will have pleased no one entirely yet made it harder for anyone to sprint headlong into catastrophe, and you accept the anger you will buy as the price of a wider calm.\", \"outcome\": \"The Court posts an injunction slip under a trio of lanterns that make engineers scowl and wardens relax their shoulders, and Dross receives it with a jaw like locked gears before sending you a look that promises future accounting. The Order’s quiet watchers breathe moth-scented dark into the tunnels for a night and catch the faint shiver of someone testing your marks, giving the Wardens a reason to loiter near the mill without drawing swords. Your name rolls across the city like a slow drum, sometimes called bold, sometimes called traitor, but always called when the talk turns to someone who refuses to let one guild own the night. The hill keeps humming, but now it hums under two sets of bells and a slate of signatures, and haste loses the first race. You walk away with your map, your stipend, your chalk, and Kara’s promise of a skiff in any squall, and you also carry the clean ache of having made three truths fit into one narrow mouth without choking on any of them.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M4\"], \"next\": [\"M6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Map\", \"description\": \"Detailed undercroft map that you drafted among the sweating bricks, granting advantage on future movement and navigation in the Engine underworks.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Coin and Tools\", \"description\": \"Tidewrights stipend in hard coin and a set of engineer’s chalks marked with gauge codes for precise notes and countermarks.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Favor\", \"description\": \"Wardens extraction favor from Kara Dusk, redeemable for one emergency skiff pickup when the wind turns cruel.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
