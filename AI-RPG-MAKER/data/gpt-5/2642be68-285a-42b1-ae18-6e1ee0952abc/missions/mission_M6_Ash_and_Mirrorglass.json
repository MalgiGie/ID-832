    "description": "Underquay moor-lights have been bobbing over tar-still pools in the Obsidian Fen, and the smell of sootglass rides the wind like a threat. Kara Dusk tasks you to cut into the fen by a collapsed furnace and find a witch-mirror shard the Veil is using to bind debts; those who look into it owe a night. The shard may hold names tied to the Tidewrights’ shadow accounts. Ysil Kett, a Veil lieutenant who keeps his margins tidy and his blade cleaner, offers to meet under truce and ‘trade clarity for discretion’. The fen cuts like slate underfoot, and your breath comes back with iron in it. The mirror shows not your face but a ledger of choices, and your own night owed wavers in the dark like a drowned bell.",

Here is my offer: you give me one night where the Bastion blinks, and I give you a list of names that rhyme with the Engine’s heart. Look in the mirror if you like. It will show you what you already know, and that is how it keeps you."

You’ll give me the names because you want a city that wakes up tomorrow, and because if you don’t I’ll bring your mirror to the Court and let them read it out loud as they stoke their lanterns. I know what I owe, Ysil. I’m here to decide who I pay."
