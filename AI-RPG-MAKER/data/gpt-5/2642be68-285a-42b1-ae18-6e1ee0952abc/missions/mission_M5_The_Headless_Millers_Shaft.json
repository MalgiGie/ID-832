    "description": "The Tidewrights want the buried transmission shaft under Gallowhill reconnected to the Tide-Engine to ‘stabilize drift’—language that sounds like safety and tastes like leverage. Mavek Dross, a foreman with a voice like creaking timber, hires you to walk the undercroft, inspect the bricked mouth of the old shaft, and report on sabotage risks. He is not gentle and he is not a fool; he wants a blunt instrument he can claim was an independent eye. The hill sighs when the wind is in a certain quarter, and locals say the Headless Miller straightens ropes at night. In the murk of old gears and damp stone, you find fresh chalk marks matching Tomas’s bypass sketch. The old shaft hums like a held-in breath.",

        "Decide whether to report findings fully to Mavek Dross or redact details.",

You will go down there and tell me whether I can trust old bricks to stay in their lane. If you find a lie laid in mortar, write its name on your report and I’ll grind it to dust with the rest."

I’ll walk your dark and count your bolts, but if I find a path that leads straight to a dry basin, you’ll hear my boots on the Court’s floor before you hear them on yours."

I’ll keep a skiff at the base in case you need to ride a downdraft to the river. Don’t look for the Miller; he helps those who don’t mock him and trips those who do."

If you hand Mavek the whole truth he’ll build a shrine to its usefulness. If you hand him half, he’ll fill the gap with concrete and call it faith."
