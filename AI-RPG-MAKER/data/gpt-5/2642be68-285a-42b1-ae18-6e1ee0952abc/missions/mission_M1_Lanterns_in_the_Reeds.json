    "description": "A harvest barge vanished on a moonless turn in the Shardmere, and the Lantern Court needs answers before rumor becomes riot. Inspector Daru Fenlik, eyes red from long nights under soot-lamps, presses a sealed writ and a waxed packet into your palm. The writ grants you temporary authority to investigate canalside and reedbeds; the packet holds charcoal sketches of a cove at the beds’ edge where black-glass reeds are said to sing a cracking note. The city is tense: the Weavers whisper about sabotage, the Tidewrights blame smugglers, and pilots in Molden Quays add fresh knots to the memorial rope. Daru wants you to find the barge’s lanterns, retrieve any ledger or route tokens, and bring what you learn to the House of Quiet Wings, where the Order will test the soot on the wicks. You will need a pilot who knows the reeds’ moods; Nelai Pruen, a fisher who reads knots like scripture, is waiting by a skiff with oars wrapped in mothcloth.",

Don’t mistake my manners for friendship; I have a stack of writs prepared for the day the city drowns in rumor and I will sign them without a tremor if I must. Bring me lanterns, not stories, and if the Veil has a hand on this rope I want to feel it burn."

I’ll find what burned and who set the flame, and I’ll lay it on your mosaic river so you can point a finger without guessing. But don’t ask me to twist a pilot’s tongue for your ledger’s comfort."

The cove we’re headed to hums wrong in a south wind, and the fish turn to glass when you stare too long. If the Reedmother knotted those channels to keep fools out, we’ll ask permission with our oars and go in on the hush."

Soot remembers the last breath that fed it; in stillness, it will tell us whether it tasted fear or calculation. The House will speak softly in return, as we always do, but make no mistake: if the night itself warned us last winter, this is not the end of the warning."
