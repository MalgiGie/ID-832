    "description": "The Archive of Unnamed Days needs the bell-chart from Farsong Monastery Ruins to decode a palimpsest overlaying Thyssara with an older moth-shaped city. Seler Daki, a scribe with ink under every nail and a memory for the sound of rain, asks you to guide him to the cliffside cloister. The wind there eats words and turns them into music, and the lower cells are painted with moths and bells that have not rung in a century. A cave behind a broken organ pipe is said to breathe warm air and whisper of a market with no dawn; Seler wants nothing from that market, only the chart in the abbot’s cell. The sea may be visible, a knife of iron-blue on the horizon; the path is narrow, the past narrower.",

With it, the palimpsest in our Archive will stop crawling under my fingers and lie still long enough to be read. Walk ahead of me when the path narrows; I do not mind staring at your back if it means I do not stare into the drop."

Whistle twice if the wind turns sour and I’ll throw you a rope from above. I don’t trust monasteries that make music when no one’s there. That’s a kind of hunger."

We’ll take the chart, we’ll leave the market, and if any old bells try to recruit us, we’ll answer with our feet. Keep your eyes on the stone and I’ll keep the wind honest."
