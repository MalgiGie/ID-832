    "description": "Tomas Helwin, the Tidewright surveyor you once dragged from the thief’s gate, sends you a folded reed-paper diagram through a child runner. The diagram outlines a hidden bypass valve threaded under the Tide-Engine’s lowest floor—a thing that could drain the city basins dry if opened. Tomas is rattled; he believes someone is testing the bypass at night to shave bells from turnover and launder bribes in the turbulence. He asks you to steal a shadow ledger from the Tide-Engine House and to convince Gate-Mistress Ruli Saan to speak privately, as she saved lives by flooding the thief’s gate once and may know who punished her for it. The Engine is a cathedral of gears; you know the hum of each chain, but you will have to walk like a ghost to keep from waking them.",

I’ve measured the Engine’s heartbeat since, and something new is ticking inside the old heart. If this bypass opens all the way, we don’t get a second bell to warn us. We wake to dry basins and a city on its knees."

I’ll walk your wheels and steal your ledger, and if Ruli still trusts me I’ll give her a chance to put her name in the right place in the story. But if I see anyone with ash on their mask walking your floors, I won’t be quiet about it."

I flooded the thief’s gate because the river spoke faster than the bell, and I’ll do it again if it comes to that. I’ve heard metal sigh under my feet that wasn’t part of the plan, Kade. Bring me proof and I’ll blow a whistle that shatters teeth."

The Consortium runs the river on time; that’s why bakers bake and judges judge. If you bring the Lanterns a story with my name in it, make sure it’s sung in the correct key, or the river might develop a taste for inconvenient heroes."
