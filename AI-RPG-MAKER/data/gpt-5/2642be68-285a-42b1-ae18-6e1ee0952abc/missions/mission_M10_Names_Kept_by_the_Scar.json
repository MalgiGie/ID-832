    "description": "The Mothfast starves the lightwell, but not before it whispers a coordinate, a rhythm in rivets, a promise that a hidden hand rests beneath the tenth gate. To use the runecap’s tone in the Engine’s bones, you must reclaim your name in full, for the Scar will not let you strike a true note if it still holds a syllable of you. Mira Cael, steady and spare with words, offers a skiff and a rope. Pesha Lume meets you at the Scar’s rim with a jar of silence. The bowl glows faintly; echoes pile like leaves in windless corners. Your voice, reversed and iron-sweet, is waiting for you like an old injury.",

If you’re not back by the second hundred, I come down with a knife and an apology. Don’t make me choose between your lungs and your pride."

When you hear yourself say what you most want to hear, close your eyes and breathe out until your ribs ache. Your true name will be the one that sounds tired and still keeps walking."

Take my hand and you will not have to wake up in any more storms. Refuse me and I will wait by your last dawn and take what is mine when your jaw is soft."
