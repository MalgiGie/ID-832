    "description": "The Ember Dunes hum with buried glass veins, and a storm that spits green lightning has started throwing shadows toward Thyssara. Orel Vaska, a caravan master whose face looks carved by sun and sand, asks you to ride escort for three wagons of saffron and to retrieve a still-bright runecap said to have rolled loose from the Skybridge Ruins. The runecap’s etchings can lock a tone in metal—useful for decoding star-law and for bending bells to chosen notes. The Wardens want a sample of the storm’s residue; the Tidewrights want to hear how the runecap sings under tension. Between mirage-bandits and the Singing Titan that hates iron, the dunes demand respect and clean water. The reward is coin, yes, but also a tool to sing the truth into stubborn places.",
    "objectives": [
        "Escort Orel Vaska’s saffron wagons safely across the Ember Dunes.",
        "Investigate the storm spitting green lightning and collect residue safely.",
        "Retrieve the runecap from the Skybridge Ruins without damaging the etchings.",
        "Negotiate safe passage past mirage-bandits or defeat them.",
        "Deliver the runecap to the House of Quiet Wings and the residue to the Wardens."

The runecap is a side errand, but the kind that pays for a funeral when things go wrong. Keep your iron close and your pride closer; the dunes punish both."

We’ll bring back your spice and your etched star, and if the bandits try to sell us a horizon I’ll pay them with a rope around their lies. Keep the camels in line and the water shaded."
