    "description": "The palimpsest’s reading and the runecap’s hum agree: a lightwell is widening beneath the Prism Spire, and every lit lamp feeds it a heartbeat. The Order proposes a Mothfast—a citywide dark of one night—to starve the widening and reset the tone. Lysa Curren, hard-nosed and practical, asks you to broker the fast with guilds and quays so furnaces don’t crack and children don’t go hungry. The Wardens fear a night of unlit streets; the Veil tastes opportunity; the Tidewrights bristle at being told how to schedule the river’s breath. You will carry a bell-chart endorsed by the Order and the Exchange, and you will pin it to doors that do not like to be pinned.",

        "Present the Mothfast proposal to the Lantern Court and secure provisional sanction.",
        "Negotiate with the Wardens of the Windward for patrol coverage in the dark.",

        "Ensure the Guild of Glassreed Weavers can bank furnaces safely for one night.",
        "Deter Smoulder Veil arson attempts during the fast and keep the peace."

I can cool furnaces if you promise me pilots who don’t sleep and moth-keepers who keep their promises. I don’t deal in omens, Kade. I deal in cracking points and how to avoid them."

            "line": "Mothfast is a tasty word. It sounds like silence and smells like doors left on the latch. I can promise you my people will leave the furnaces to their dreams and keep the underquay calm. In return, I want a Night Tax that doesn’t bind us like a docked barge. You don’t have to say yes now. Just don’t say no when we come back with contracts."
