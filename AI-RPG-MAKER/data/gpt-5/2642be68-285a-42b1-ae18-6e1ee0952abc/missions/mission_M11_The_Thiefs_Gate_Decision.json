    "description": "Storm drums roll from Windward Bastion; the River Aur swells and the city holds its breath. Aren Mir calls in every favor you owe him and some you don’t: it’s time to crawl under the Tide-Engine and put a hand on the hidden bypass. Tomas Helwin waits with a crowbar and a prayer; Mavek Dross denies everything and stands ready to take credit for whatever saves the city. The plan is knife-thin: slip into the underworks during the surge, use the runecap’s tone to stun the bypass linkage, and flood the thief’s gate for seconds, not minutes, to bleed pressure without cracking the basins. The Wardens will cover the quays; the Compact will pull lines in rhythm; the Veil will either stay home or learn to swim. If you fail, the city wakes to drained canals and a riot that won’t end with dawn.",

I’ll be above you counting heartbeats, and if you call for water I’ll bring you the city’s share with my own hands. Don’t die where I can’t see you, Kade. I’ve buried too many boys who smelled like rope and rain."

If it screams, we pull the crowbar and let the thief’s gate drink for longer than your stomach allows. I’ll take the blame if the Court comes hungry. I’ve had my name in better ledgers than theirs."

If we are done pretending, I will say this: pull your tone, bleed your gate, and I will draft a reform that saves more lives than your heroics. Or keep your secrets and watch your city learn thirst."
