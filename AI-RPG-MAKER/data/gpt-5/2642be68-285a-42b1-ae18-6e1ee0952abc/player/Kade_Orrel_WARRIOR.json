        "description": "Broad-shouldered and canal-hardened, with sun-browned skin and saffron-bleached hair tied back in a pilot’s knot. Wears a fitted lamellar of singing-glass plates under a canvas storm cloak. Eyes the amber green of the Shardmere shallows.",
        "distinctive_signs": "Old rope-burn coils his forearms; a shard of clear glass is set in his left ear and glows faintly in mothlight; a memorial knot of red-and-ash cord is tied permanently around his right wrist."

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Born in Molden Quays to a family of Salted Compact rope-slingers, Kade learned knots before letters and the drum-calls before prayers. He grew up under the shadow of the Red Flood’s memorial rope and swore at fourteen never to let a gate take another friend. Drafted as a quay-guard and later trained at Windward Bastion under Sergeant Aren Mir, he became a boarding-shield on sky-skiffs and flood boats, escorting writs from the Hall of Lanterns and pilgrims of the Order of Moths alike. During a fog-thick turnover at the Tide-Engine House, Kade hauled a drowning Tidewright surveyor, Tomas Helwin, out of the thief’s gate whirl, and in the aftermath glimpsed diagrams of a hidden bypass that could drain Thyssara’s basins dry. When strikes pinched the quays and families went hungry, Jalen Sarq of the Smoulder Veil hired Kade to guard a sootglass run around the Obsidian Fen; he took the coin to keep food on his mother’s table and has hated the scent of burned tar ever since. After the Moth Ascension cocooned the Prism Spire, the Order contracted Kade to shield an echo-gathering at the Starfall Scar. There, in the bowl of fused night, an echo spoke his name backward and kept it. Now Kade walks a knife-edge between bells and smoke: too lawful for the Veil, too blunt for the Court, loyal to pilots, and sworn to keep the gates honest even if it means breaking ranks with old allies.",

He also holds a stolen lock-key from the Ropes and Knots Hall stash and once let a Veil runner’s death be recorded as a canal slip to keep a strike from breaking."
