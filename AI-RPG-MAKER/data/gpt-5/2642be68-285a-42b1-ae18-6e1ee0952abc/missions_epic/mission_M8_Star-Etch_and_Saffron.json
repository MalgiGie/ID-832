    "description": "Thyssara’s western horizon burns in noon-iron and dusk-wine as the Ember Dunes hum like a struck bowl, their red-gold slopes laced with buried glass veins that sing when the wind combs them. Far out, a roiling storm prowls the caravan routes and spits green lightning that writes brief, crooked sigils upon the sky, and each strike sheds a dust that tastes of tin and rain remembered. Orel Vaska has rolled his saffron wagons to the edge of the city’s last reed-shadow, the canvas bellies fat with crocus filaments worth a magistrate’s oath, and his camels shift as if hearing a deeper drum beneath the sand. He asks you, Kade Orrel, to ride escort across the murmuring sea, to keep spice and souls intact, and to use your rope-born sense for routes that move even as boots fall. The runecap rumor rides beside the spice: a still-bright capstone said to have rolled loose from the Skybridge Ruins, its star-etchings capable of locking a tone into metal so that bells keep a chosen truth and star-law yields up a stubborn whisper. Wardens of the Windward want a sealed sample of that storm’s green residue for their wind-tunnels, the Tidewrights salivate to hear how the runecap sings under tension, and the Order of Moths bids you swaddle its voice in silence until night can ask its name without frightening it into lies. Between mirage-bandits who sell horizons, the Singing Titan that hates iron and stirs dunes like water, and the old hunger that rides every caravan when canteens lean thin, the road demands respect, patience, and clean shadowed water. The reward is coin measured in saffron sunlight, yes, but also a key-shaped music to turn in stubborn locks, a commendation that opens wind, and the chance to make the city’s bells remember the right note when danger comes at speed.",

You guard my line and I will put your name in the Exchange ledger with ink that will not wash in storm or settlement, and I will swear that ink on the memorial rope if you ask. The runecap is a side errand as I said, but it is the kind that buys funerals when one goes wrong and buys a feast when one goes right, and I would rather you eat than the sand. Keep your iron close and your pride closer, because the dunes punish both when they smell them, and the Titan underfoot hates the taste of iron so much it will roll a whole hill to spit it out. I have seen mirage-bandits sell a thirsty man his own shadow and leave him lighter by three skins and a wedding ring, and the trick of not buying a lie is to own your horizon before they price it."

I will have a Wardens skiff shadow you on the dune ridges and keep you within the net of our drumline, but we will not land if the Titan stirs because a skiff’s keel is a veintone that wakes old bones. If the storm comes down to bite, ground your spear, not your feet, because the lightning will chase a man who thinks he is taller than the dune and prove him wrong. Bind your iron in felt and sing dull as you go, because bright edges make a kind of music the Titan resents, and a resentful mountain is a poor companion. If you find the residue, seal it in glass with no air and mark the jar with the hour you took it, because residue goes to war with time the moment it breathes."

Wrap it in mothcloth and hum a steady note to remind it of the night, because night is the only room in which such memories behave themselves. Do not oil its face or wipe the grit too quickly, for the shallow dust that rides the etches is part of its story and stories bruise when scrubbed. If the cap presses a hum into your bones, set it down and breathe through your nose until the hum leaves by itself, because forced silence sours into lies. Bring it to the House of Quiet Wings, and we will let it sleep in a dark bowl until it is ready to tell us which star it used to listen to."

The Wardens will keep a kite high and a skiff in earshot, but there are distances the wind refuses to carry, so keep your own drum in your chest and remember the call for ‘fall flat’. Mirage-bandits are not brave so much as patient, and they will set a story at your feet and wait for you to step into it, so look up as much as you look ahead. When thunder writes in green, count heartbeats between lines, because the third line is a feint and the fourth is a hook, and you do not want to taste the hook. If the Exchange men test your temper, remember that saffron is heavier than a grudge and that wagons roll better than pride."

The Veil has ferried spice for men who swore they would spit on our shadows, and those men still eat, so set your mouth when you judge and open your hand when it is time to pay. Mirage-bandits sell certainty and thirst in the same cup, and the price is always more than the coin they quote, so carry a second purse with promises you can afford to break. If you must fight, fight at dusk when the light is tired, because the dunes do not like to choose between two hungers and they will choose you if you make them. Bring me back a sliver of that green-storm dust and I will pay a debt you have not even asked to collect, and then we will both owe each other the right kinds of silence."

We will bring back your spice and your etched star, Orel, and if the bandits try to sell us a horizon I will pay them with a rope around their lies and a knot they cannot breathe through. I will wrap iron like a lullaby and keep our shadows close to our boots, and I will count the storm’s green strokes like a miser counts coin until the last heartbeat buys us calm. If the Titan turns under us, we will turn with it and call it a dance, and we will bow when it stops because even mountains like manners. When the bells of Thyssara ask what song we heard, I want to answer with a note that does not bend, and a truth that does not crack in the cold."

Keep the wagons low and the flags dull, and submit to Warden hand-sign checks at every planned stop even when Orel grumbles at the lost bells. When the storm prowls close, dig shallow wind-pits for the camels, ground your spearpoints, and ride out the lightning with your back to a dune that has not moved in the last hour. Refuse parley with mirage-bandits unless they step into the Wardens’ shadow, and insist on oath-water called over the Oath of the Three Winds before a word of trade is spoken. Accept that the skiff will not land if the Titan stirs and plan your rescue ropes for distance, trusting that discipline in open ground is its own kind of armor.",
            "outcome": "The bandits do not like the taste of the Wardens’ presence and keep their tricks at the horizon, so you cross with fewer lies to swat and more time to hear the sand’s real voice. The storm’s green spit still licks the air, but your grounded iron and clean protocols keep the lightning from choosing any of your people, and the residue you collect is uncontaminated and neatly time-marked. The skiff’s witness earns you a tidy commendation and a clean report at Windward Bastion, and Mira Cael names you as a captain who can count to calm in a gale. Orel chafes at the delays but pays your full due, and the Exchange ledger ink dries without a smudge beside your name. However, your refusal to treat with bandits hardens their opinion of you, and a rumor of ‘Court dog’ follows your tracks into the dunes, setting future ambushes to be sharper but less patient."

Lay a small measure of saffron and a skin of clean water in the sand as earnest coin, and demand in return the safe shadow of three dunes and a guide through a glass vein that hums like a good loom. Keep your hand on your rope, your eyes on the horizon, and your temper under the shade of your hood while they tell you a price that includes a story about your mother’s luck. When they try to sell you your own map, sell them pride instead by telling a better story about the river that taught you to read lies by how they float. Bind the bargain with a dusk knot and a shared mouthful of dust, and do not flinch when their mirrors show you walking away empty-handed, because that is how they say ‘we will not chase you today’.",
            "outcome": "The bandits take the saffron and the story and give you a guide whose footprints sing when stepped on, and the caravan flows in their wake without waking the Titan’s ear. You lose a small profit but gain a longer peace, and the dunes around you feel less eager to roll, as if a quarrel had been postponed rather than settled. The Wardens grumble in their skiff and file a note that you trafficked courtesy with thieves, but they cannot argue with wagons delivered intact and jars of residue sealed without scorch. Orel marks you as a negotiator who spends wisely when the market is made of heat and thirst, and the Salted Compact hears you used their knots with honor and buys you a round with clean cups. The Smoulder Veil notices the shape of your generosity and files it beside other debts, which can mean a shadow steps in your way later to offer a favor you would rather not owe."

Bury iron stakes in a crescent and cover them with felt until the last breath, then rip the felt free as the bandits charge so the Titan feels the sting and rolls a warning under their feet. Charge with rope and hook when they stumble, pull riders from saddles and bind their wrists to the wagon rails with knots that will not come loose until the moon has considered their promises. Keep the fight short and loud and honest, a thunder that drowns their sleek whispers, and leave no blade uncollected when the sand goes quiet. Mark your fallen, if there are any, with a knot on the memorial rope you carry and a breath shared with the wind, because the dunes forget the names of the proud first and the kind last.",
            "outcome": "The ambush cracks like ice and the bandits break in a scatter of shouts, leaving behind mirrors and a single good horse that knows your hand, and for a week the dunes hold their breath when your shadow passes. The Titan’s ripple comes as planned and not as wrath, but it still moves your markers and costs you an hour of careful re-scouting, and you learn again that mountains are not hammers to be swung twice in the same story. You gather green residue in the quiet afterward, its jar warm with the memory of the fight, and the Wardens write a tidy commendation with notes about your decisive application of force. The Exchange pays without haggling and the Wardens tip their hats, but the Order of Moths looks at the bruises on the runecap’s cloth and asks careful questions about whether victory sang too loud in your ears. Bandit kin swear by dust and salt to make a red path for you next time, and your name grows heavier in the mouths of men who watch the horizon and sharpen glass."

Move by night when the wind cools from pain into memory and steer by the faint hum of buried veins, letting the mothwax in your pocket guide your breath to a steady, human key. When the storm flashes, lie still and hum back at it through closed teeth, a note of refusal that is not a challenge, and wait for the green to blink away like an insult that fails to land. Speak to the camels the way you would speak to a wet rope, which is to say with patience and clear intent, and thank the sand out loud when it lets you pass, because gratitude weighs less than iron and buys more time. At the Skybridge Ruins, kneel and listen before you touch, and when the runecap answers in your bones, answer it with a sleep-song and a promise that its first word back in Thyssara will be heard by moths and not by money.",
            "outcome": "The dunes cool and slacken around you, and the Titan turns beneath without waking into anger, as if it has been remembered instead of provoked, and the path smooths between hummocks as though laid by an invisible hand. You reach the storm’s shed skin in the still heart of the night and collect residue that clings to glass like frost, its heat spent, its shape intact, and the Wardens later remark it is the cleanest sample they have seen. The runecap lies where the ruin bled it, and it comes away without a scratch beneath your mothcloth, its hum meeting your song and quieting like a child carried out of a room that is too bright. Orel watches you treat stone like a guest and spice like a vow and pays you not only in coin but in a promise of future caravans that want quiet captains. The Wardens scold you for slipping the skiff’s shadow and warn that heroes who walk without kites sometimes fall without witnesses, but they still open the wind-tunnels when the commendation is inked because results stack higher than lectures."
