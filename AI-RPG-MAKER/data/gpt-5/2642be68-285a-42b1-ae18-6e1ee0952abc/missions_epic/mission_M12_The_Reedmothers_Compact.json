    "description": "The flood is bled, the bypass stunned, and the city breathes easier, but the channels still knot themselves on moonless nights, as if a hidden hand loops them into dread. Nelai Pruen comes to you with wet hair and solemn eyes, river-salt drying on her sleeves and a pilot’s steadiness in her breath, saying the reed island has risen under a sliver moon and waits in the hush where oars dare not knock. The founders bargained with the Reedmother for safe harvests, trading moonlight for mercy and leaving a silence in the bells that has since been betrayed by ambition and fear. Now Thyssara must bargain again, not for glinting profit or precision schedules alone, but for nights that do not run on terror and for gates that do not chew the poor first. You will boat with Nelai to the island that isn’t there by day, carrying the runecap taken from star-etched stone, the bell-chart copied by Seler Daki in patient mothlight, and a promise written in your own hand: a pilot’s seat in any council that sets the river’s breath. The Reedmother speaks in currents and in the hush of reeds against wood, and you must listen with your hands, your knots, and the memory of every drowned name you have ever counted.",

        "Sail with Nelai Pruen to the appearing island under a sliver moon.",
        "Offer the runecap and a copy of the bell-chart as tokens of respect.",

            "lines": "Do not point at the island when it rises, Kade, not with finger or blade, not even with your thoughts if you can help it, because the water notices pride before it notices prayer. Keep your oar low so the ferrule never kisses the rim, and keep your breath lower so your fear does not make ripples that can be counted like coins. The Reedmother does not love us, and I would not trust anyone who did after we rang bells we promised to keep asleep, but she remembers us, and that memory is a rope we can still hold. I will speak the names of the drowned as we approach, from the Red Flood’s first to last week’s nameless boy, and you will keep count with your fingers so the river knows our tally and finds no missing number to punish. The runecap rides in the bow and the bell-chart is sealed in mothwax under my left knee, and when the reeds lean all to one side, you will lift the runecap and set it on the thwart so the old note steadies our hands. When she comes close, do not flinch at the sound like wind inside glass; it is only her voice in another shape, and if you listen with your fingers on the oarlock you will hear the meaning before your ears do. If she asks who we are, tell her we are the city’s breath and that we are tired of choking ourselves; that truth has weight even in water."

            "lines": "You come with the song of fallen bridges on your tongue and a jar that smells of moths and rain, and you think a shard-capped word will keep you from circling until dawn. The night does not owe you safety, little stilts and ropes; it owes you only a place to ask with both hands open and your pride wrapped in reed. I remember those who promised me a silence in the bells when floods were bound, and I remember the day your metal flowers drank the river’s anger and spat it into Molden Quays; memory is a long stalk with thorns at its joints. You have rung the third bell at dawn on a day that should be swallowed, and you have trimmed the reeds near my sleeping child without counting to seven between each cut. Do not lie to me; reeds hear lies the way glass hears a thrown stone, and I have watched your lanterns tremble with fear and greed and hunger all braided together. I smell the ear-glass in the man with rope-burn wrists and the old grief bound at his right hand, and I hear that he once traded a name to a scar that keeps it still; do not try to hide that from me. If you mean to ask for nights that do not knot boats to their own terror, then speak in currents, not in bells, and let the chart speak for your city’s humility."

            "lines": "I bring you a runecap that holds a note steady when our hands shake, a bell-chart that remembers how to be a city without cracking, and a promise written in calluses that learned knots before letters. Give Thyssara nights that don’t twist our channels into traps, give us moon-slices with no drowned tally at dawn, and we will seat pilots with rope-wise hands in the rooms where levers live and where schedules are braided. We will keep the third bell silent on Flood-Binding Day as your memory demands, and when hunger looks at our poorest, we will bring grain to the alleys without waiting for a schedule to permit mercy. Take my word and bind it to my wrist if you must, for there is already a memorial knot waiting for one more duty, and my rope-burns have room for another lesson. I will carry the scent you ask for when the moon is a nail paring, and I will pour it where you tell me, so sky-etch and water know one another again like kin long parted. I do not ask you to love us, only to remember us into gentler braids, and I will carry your warning back to bells that think themselves the only law."

            "speaker": "The Reedmother",
            "lines": "Three conditions, and I speak them as roots speak to water, slow and without mercy for those who do not listen. First, your dawn bell sleeps on Flood-Binding Day and wakes only to call the names of those the water kept, and if the bell rings a third tone for trade or pride on that day, the reeds will wrap your oars until your arms ache with apology. Second, a pilot will sit where schedules are braided, and no gate shall close without a hand that knows rope on its lever, for a city that closes blindly deserves its own darkness. Third, you will return the scent of the star-etch to the water when the moon is a nail paring, so the sky remembers what it broke and does not lean its weight against your fragile tins and chains again. I will knot your channels into gentler braids and teach the wind to sleep in the tall reeds when your boats slide past, if your words keep time with your deeds. Fail, and I will tie your boats to the same reed until hunger teaches you again, and then I will let the wind chatter your lanterns until fear eats your schedules from the inside. Do not bring me blood, do not bring me tears, bring me silence where it is due, and the smell of honest rope and old mothwax will be welcome in my sleep."

            "lines": "Present the compact and stand with your back straight, Kade Orrel, because the Lantern Court hates being told the river has opinions, but they hate riots, famine, and pilot strikes much more than they hate humility. Bring me your conditions written on reed-pith and I’ll file them where no one’s ink can smudge them, and I will seat that filing in a niche no clerk can call a draft by accident. We will read the oath aloud at the Oath-well so even the echo has to nod, and we will light only two bells that morning so the city feels the third’s absence like a stone in the shoe and remembers why. Magistrate Vela Orun will ask whether a lake can sign, and I will answer that the city already signed when it decided not to drown and sent a pilot and a rope-scarred guard to speak in currents. Expect the Tidewrights to clatter their wrenches and speak of precision, and expect the Wardens to ask for a carve-out that keeps their sky-drums inviolate, but the reeds’ conditions will sit heavier than their counterweights if we keep our language clean. If anyone asks who gave you the right to parley with a lake, tell them the founders did when they traded moonlight for mercy, and that we are only renewing a debt with better ink and steadier hands."

            "text": "You accept the three conditions without ornament and choose to seal the compact with the rites Nelai teaches, using silence rather than spectacle. You and Nelai weave a pilot’s knot from fresh reed fibers around the runecap’s rim, your hands moving in time with the names you are still counting beneath your breath. You set the bell-chart on your knees and let mothwax soften under your palm, so its scent meets the river’s cool skin when the chart is tipped toward the water. You speak no grand words, only the simple promise that pilots will sit where levers live and that the third bell will sleep on Flood-Binding Day, and you let the reeds brush the hull like witnesses. The Reedmother’s presence thins until the reeds lie down as if to sleep, and a long, low note moves through the oarlock, as if the runecap nodded. You feel the channels around the island breathe out, and the current bears you homeward as if it already knows the way.",
            "outcome": "On your return, the canals of Thyssara seem to listen rather than resist, and the pilots you pass lift fingers in a quiet thank-you that speaks of relief rather than triumph. Daru Fenlik receives the reed-pith text of the conditions and threads it into the Court’s record with a scribe’s calm, and even the Wickwards polishing lamps move a little slower, as if to honor the sleeping bell. The Tidewrights grumble about precedent but cannot deny the union seat if they expect boats to move on time, and Master Helvar Kint measures your promise with a narrow glance and chooses, for now, not to make an enemy of the river. The Wardens press for language protecting sky-drums and emergency signals, and you help write a clause that respects the Flood-Binding silence without weakening life-saving calls, keeping night-law and common sense braided. The Smoulder Veil tests a fog-run and finds channels too honest for their favorite trick, and the rumor spreads that the Reedmother’s eye is open and not easily lied to. The compact is ratified with a solemnity that tastes like clean water, and you walk away with the knowledge that the river’s first answer to you was yes, so long as you keep your hands true."

            "title": "Ask for a year of grace",
            "text": "You accept the conditions in spirit but ask the Reedmother to grant a year of grace for the city to unlearn bad bells and teach wary hands new habits. You explain that schedules are bone and bread in Thyssara, and that a sudden silence might break the wrong things first if fear is allowed to set the pace. You promise a phased honoring of Flood-Binding Day that begins with half the wards keeping the third bell asleep, then all, and you name the alleys where hunger bites hardest to prove you know the stakes. You pledge to seat pilots immediately on the gate councils while the Court and guilds craft the precise writs, and you offer to carry the star-etch scent yourself each nail-paring moon without fail. Nelai touches the runecap and says she will track your keeping on the pilot wall, so no one pretends the year is a fog that hides cowardice. The reeds answer with a drowsy hiss, like teeth unclenching, and the current slows as if to measure the honesty of your timing.",
            "outcome": "The Reedmother’s acceptance comes as a weight in your palms rather than a whisper in your ears, and you understand that grace is not mercy but a loan to be repaid with steady deeds. Back in the city, the Lantern Court marks the year in the Hall of Unnumbered Calendars and stamps the first writs naming pilot seats, while Magistrate Vela Orun warns you that any stumble will be tallied aloud. The Tidewrights seize on the timeline to present clean protocols that actually bind their hands more than they expected, and they are too proud to admit it, which suits you. The Wardens agree to train their drumlines to a two-bell cadence on Flood-Binding Day, and you help them practice until even Captain Aramus Dene concedes that silence can be a shield rather than a weakness. Smoulder Veil agitators try to make the year a weapon by claiming the Court will forget, but Nelai’s tally knots appear on doorframes across Molden Quays and shame cheats into stillness. When the year turns, the compact is ratified with the city already moving to its new rhythm, and the river’s braids lie softer around your boats as if acknowledging that patience was the right lever."

            "id": "C3",
            "title": "Make the vow before witnesses and bells",
            "text": "You tell the Reedmother you will honor her privacy on the water but anchor the promise in public so cowards cannot pretend it never happened. You propose to pour the star-etch scent into the Oath-well at Candlecourt with Order of Moths witnesses and a Warden drum, then carry the same scent to the Shardmere when the moon is a nail paring, binding sky, city, and lake in a single circuit. You promise to speak the names of the drowned aloud in the Hall of Lanterns and inscribe them into the reed-pith of the compact so that grief is not only a private salt but a public ledger. You ask Nelai to stand with you and place a pilot’s buoy-stone on the Mosaic River floor, while you lay the runecap upon the Oath-well rim to catch and hold the promise’s tone. You assure the Reedmother that this spectacle is not for vanity but for memory, because people forget what they do not ritualize, and you admit that your own name is kept elsewhere and you would rather not lose any more truth in the dark. The reeds shift as if a school of fish turned at once, and a ripple runs the length of the island like a nod.",
            "outcome": "The Reedmother’s consent arrives as a pale ring on the well-water when you later pour the star-etch scent before the Lantern Court, a ring that holds without breaking as if a steady hand cups it from below. The Order of Moths light no flame and yet the hall brightens, and Archivist Pellen Var’s fingers pause over a jar labeled with a day that never was, as if memory agreed to let this day be. Wardens and pilots together place the buoy-stone and the runecap, and a hush falls over Candlecourt so complete that even the maggots of gossip die for a heartbeat. The Tidewrights concede a pilot seat with only a formal cough, calculating that open defiance would lose them coin and face now that the city has made a theater of humility. Smoulder Veil brokers try to heckle from the aisles, but the silence of two bells swallows their grit and spits it back as shame, and even Jalen Sarq leaves a small space in his ledger for hope. The compact is ratified with a stamp that sounds like a little wave, and when you carry the second measure of scent to the Shardmere under the nail-paring moon, the reeds part for your boat as if you were a long-expected oar."
