    "description": "Underquay moor-lights have been bobbing over tar-still pools in the Obsidian Fen, and the smell of sootglass rides the wind like a threat. The fen is a bruise of black water and glassy pumice, a place where footsteps ring like dull bells and debts are said to rise in the vapors. Kara Dusk tasks you to cut into the fen by a collapsed furnace whose bell-tower now lies sidewise like a drowned throat, and to bring back a witch-mirror shard the Veil is using to bind nights with signatures of breath. Ysil Kett, a Veil lieutenant who keeps his margins tidy and his blade cleaner, offers to meet under truce upon a pumice hummock and ‘trade clarity for discretion’, promising names that might wick straight to the Tidewrights’ shadow accounts if you dim the city for one quiet bell. Wind moves with the patience of a ledger here; the peat cuts like slate, and every canal lesson you ever learned feels unsteady underfoot. The mirror shows not your face but a ledger of choices, written in the ripple of your pupils, and your own night owed wavers in the dark like a drowned bell that remembers your hand on its rope.",

Bring me a shard we can read and we’ll see which names burn hottest, because paper lies but glass keeps score long after throats go quiet. Do not let it read you, Kade, not once and never twice, because a mirror in that fen doesn’t show faces; it shows debts, and a debt is a current that drags until lungs forget air. You’ll go in by the collapsed bell-tower kiln where the soot still tastes of iron; keep to the pumice shoulders and avoid the pools that don’t ripple when you breathe. If Ysil Kett offers truce, take the words but not his measure, for he counts in nights and blood the way clerks count in coin and ink, and he will try to buy a bell from you as if time were a fruit on a quay stall. I’ll have a writ ready at Candlecourt to receive the shard the moment you return, and I’ll stand between you and the Court’s hungriest questions if you stand between the city and another night burned hollow. Remember: the Red Flood started with a single jam, and a jam begins with someone who thought a corner could be turned without the river noticing."

Here is my offer: you give me one night where the Bastion blinks, a single bell when the Wardens look west instead of down, and I give you a list of names that rhyme with the Engine’s heart and beat when the river does. Look in the mirror if you like, brave rope-burn, and it will show you what you already know: that every good deed you carry has a shadow the length of the Quiet Walks, and that your night owed sways like a moored skiff in an undertow you pretend not to feel. Bring the shard to your lantern-priests if you must, but bring it after we have skimmed the salt from its surface, and I’ll make sure your pilots don’t feel teeth in the fog for a season. I keep my blade clean and my ledgers cleaner, and I have no wish to see Thyssara drown in its own sense of virtue; a city has to breathe between bells or it turns blue. Take the truce, Kade Orrel, because the alternative is a kind of honesty that leaves no one standing, and I have no time for ruins that can’t pay rent."

You’ll give me the names because you want a city that wakes up tomorrow, and because if you don’t I’ll bring your mirror to the Court and let them read it out loud as they stoke their lanterns until the soot on your masks turns to confession. I know what I owe, Ysil, and I’ve kept worse secrets in a jar no bigger than my thumb, but debt isn’t destiny and shame isn’t law. The fen smells like the run I took for you once, and my mother still keeps the food that coin bought in the same jar as her fear, so don’t mistake my mercy for ignorance. I’m here to decide who I pay and how loud the bells will be when the paying is done, and I will not let the river write that decision in red again. If you truly want a night of breathing space, then prove you can breathe without choking someone else for it."

I can work with that, and by ‘work’ I mean I can braid writ to warrant until even a Tidewright’s shadow account has to step into daylight to keep from suffocating. You flinched when it looked at you, and I wrote that down too, not to use against you unless you make me choose, but to remember that courage is not the same as invulnerability. Don’t make me choose between your usefulness and your secrets, Orrel, because the Lantern Court collects both and keeps them in different jars that sit on the same shelf. We will read this glass once and only once, with witnesses and a water seal, and then we will gild the edges so it looks like a sainted mirror no one will dare to gaze into twice. Keep your nights clean, bring your truths unbroken, and I will see you repaid in the only currency worth a wound: time you can spend without checking the door."

You speak of pilots and gate-crush, of nights when the bells had to be ignored to save four souls in one skiff, and Ysil listens with the stillness of a knife laid flat on a ledger. You tell him that a city needs breath between bells, but that breath cannot be stolen from throats he cut; if he wants a night where the Bastion blinks, it must be a blink that saves more than it endangers. You set your terms in the language of the quays—one bell of drift for one coil of truth—and you demand a list that sings true even when struck by the Court’s hardest tone. The truce is a fragile thing, like glass cooled in the open air, but you hold it steady with the weight of your own name and the promise that you will not let it be used to drown another.",
            "outcome": "Ysil produces a folded slate of thin mirrorglass shavings with names etched backward so they read forward only in lamplight, and you feel the tide of his organization shift a finger’s breadth away from fire. He grants you a marker of forbearance—a soot-black token with his mark—promising one guaranteed look-away on a night of your choosing, and he swears by the Veil’s breath that no Compact pilot will eat iron for that bell. The Wardens will later taste the blink in their teeth and grumble at the Windward Bastion, and Captain Aramus Dene will mark your file with a question shaped like a hook, but the city wakes the next day without smoke in its lungs. The shard comes to your hand wrapped in oilcloth, unlooked at and unnamed, and the names on Ysil’s list rhyme in dangerous ways with Tidewright ledgers you have held once before. The Lantern Court will accept the package with pinched lips but they will take it, and in taking it they will owe you a favor they can neither write down nor deny when the bell next calls your name."

            "text": "You let the truce hang in the air like a lantern with no oil and you cut it with a single word, reminding Ysil that some debts are paid only in daylight. You surge through fen-slick and pumice grit with a boarding hook in one fist and your reedblade whispering, and the Veil’s knives find only cloak and the hollow of your steps. You use the old sky-skiff drills Aren Mir taught you, binding wrists with rope that remembers the difference between restraint and cruelty, and you scatter the moor-lights with your heel so the mirror loses its hunger for eyes. You lift the shard by its rim without looking, hearing it hum as if it remembered your name, and you leave a single warning knotted into a hummock root: no more mirrors in Thyssara’s night. Ysil’s breath turns to smoke behind you, and his promise of discretion turns to a vow you will taste again, but the fen accepts your exit like a gate takes a current when the wheel is sure.",
            "outcome": "You come away cut but not bled, and the shard is yours, veiled in double cloth and sealed with mothwax from the jar you swore you’d keep for courage. The Lantern Court receives the mirror under guard, and Daru Fenlik’s eyes narrow in cold approval that warms no one, while a court clerk tallies your restraint as if counting coins dropped rather than lives spared. The Wardens thump your shoulder at the Bastion and say you should have called them, while the Salted Compact hears how you declined to spill a working man’s blood even in a black place and quietly raises you a cup. The Veil marks you as a knife that cuts true and cuts alone, and Ysil sends a courier nights later with a single marker of forbearance and a note that reads, ‘Once, because you bound rather than broke,’ which tastes like grudging respect and the promise of future knives. The names you gleaned from the shard—less complete than the bargain would have bought but sharp enough to draw litigation—still point toward Tidewright shadows at the kilns, and the city’s law-bells ring a fraction clearer for it."

The glass does not show your face; it presses the city against your eyes and counts the nights you bent a bell to save a child and the nights you broke a promise to keep a family fed. You see Tomas Helwin’s hand on the thief’s gate rail and your own hand pulling him back, and you see the bypass diagram like a dry riverbed that could drink a city dry, and the shard writes your hesitation as a line no clerk can erase. It shows you the Veil runner who slipped under your watch, the one whose death you redrew as a canal fall to keep a strike alive, and it weighs the knot on your wrist as both memorial and ledger. The mirror does not accuse—it tallies—and when it is done the dark bell in the glass swings once and sets a night apart with your name carved backward inside it, a debt you can pay only by speaking it into a room built for echoes.",
            "outcome": "The revelation steadies you and shakes you in equal measure; you are a man who can carry a night and still climb the next ladder, but you also smell the truth of iron when it heat-blossoms, and you know the Court will smell it too if you let them. Your resolve becomes a tool rather than a chain: you can walk into Candlecourt and lay your night on the mosaic river, or you can tie it tight and keep walking until the right use for it arrives. Ysil watches you with the respect predators give to other beasts that have tasted their own blood and stayed standing, and he modulates his speech a note lower. Daru Fenlik will read your posture like a scribe reads the wind in a courtyard, and he will offer you the formal favor owed with a gaze that asks whether you prefer mercy for yourself or momentum against the Engine’s shadows. Whatever you choose later, the shard has already written it down; the only question left is who you will allow to read it."

You speak your night aloud where the mosaic river can hear you, and you let it take the shape of truth while magistrates and Wickwards listen with the stillness of a storm eye. You name the Veil runner whose death you allowed to be counted as a slip, and you name the bypass you saw in fog and did not immediately drag into light, and you refuse to make excuses even when the words shiver in your teeth. You hand the shard to Daru Fenlik while it is still warm with your confession, and you ask that your favor be used not to hide your sin but to open doors the shadow accounts have bricked. You leave the hall lighter and heavier both, wearing your debt like a scar and a lantern, and the city’s bells sound the same but not to your ear.",
            "outcome": "Magistrate Vela Orun does not smile and does not strike; she binds your night into a sealed writ that hangs from the bell-roof like a lesson and a promise, and she grants you the stated favor to seal or unseal one writ in your presence when necessity and conscience align. The Wardens hear of your confession and call it courage with their mouths and liability with their eyes, but Aren Mir squeezes your shoulder and says he taught you to run into storms, not from them. The Salted Compact spreads the word that Kade Orrel paid a night forward so pilots might not be the ones to pay it later, and a line of rope-knots at the Ropes and Knots Hall gains one more honest knot. The Veil marks you as a man who sheds shadows before they sour, and Ysil’s forbearance marker still arrives—because even wolves honor prey that turns and looks them in the eye—and it will avert one ambush when the city most needs you alive. Your confession gives the Court cleaner standing to strike at Tidewright entanglements with the fen kilns, and the names from the shard cut deeper because the hand that brought them did not tremble when it should have."

You let the magistrates read the names they need and you never let the shard catch your eyes twice, and you anchor conversation with logistics—escort lanes, seal wax, witness order—until the moment of questions slides past. You sign the ledger with a steady hand and a blank margin where your debt might have been, and you nod to Daru Fenlik in a way that says you will take the favor owed and spend it on the right day. You tell yourself that a confession spent now would be a confession wasted, because the tide against the Engine’s shadows has not yet turned enough to warrant the cost, and you knot that belief until it holds. You leave Candlecourt with a favor clasp and a secret sealed, and you promise the mirror in your memory that you will pay your night when it buys more than guilt.",
            "outcome": "The Lantern Court accepts the shard and pins its truth to warrants, and Daru Fenlik’s glance tells you he knows you are carrying something you did not set down, but he values tools that can hold weight and still lift. Your official favor is recorded in neat ink—permission to seal or unseal one writ in your presence—and it feels like a key you could use to lock a wound or open a throat, depending on the day. The Wardens respect the clean delivery and the absence of scandal, and Captain Aramus Dene’s suspicion thins without vanishing, a thread you can knot later if needed. The Veil sends the same forbearance marker through a runner who never meets your eyes, and the token feels heavier because of the silence around it; it will still avert one ambush, perhaps the one your withheld confession would have provoked. The partial list of payments linking Tidewright accounts to Obsidian Fen kilns moves through Candlecourt like a slow fire under dry reeds, and when it flares you will be there to choose which bell to ring."
