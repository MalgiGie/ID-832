Dean Yhosa Kel stands where the spine widens to a terrace of pale plates, the bone polished by centuries of feet and oaths, and the city spreads beneath like a nest cradled in a giant’s ribs. The Tidemill Array hums a toothy hymn from the jaw, and below, a constellation of Pilgrim candles drifts between arches of submerged bone as if souls were navigating the marrow of a sleeping god. Yhosa places into Mara Kestrel’s hands a lacquered chart scored with grooves fine as hair and a bone cup etched with bearings, relics of craft and patience meant to catch the whisper-song that threads the shoals. The task is to hear what most only fear: the hollow resonances struck by current through the Whispering Rib Shoals, the measured grief and thunder of a city’s foundation drawn taut by tide. With three true notes traced and compared against the Pilgrims’ hymnals, a safer passage can be anchored, the Array kept from grinding itself out of true, and the Brinelaw served with a copy any ship can trust. The sea smells of iron and winter; gulls chalk the air and Orum’s rumor-heart beats in the hush between gusts. Mara feels the familiar thrum in her bowstring and in her own ribs, a careful harmony or a warning, and wonders which it will be tonight.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Yhosa Kel on the Dorsal Span and receive the lacquered resonance chart and bearing-etched bone cup.\",\n        \"At low tide, descend by skiff to the Whispering Rib Shoals and mark three resonance points while avoiding eddies and entanglement.\",\n        \"Consult with Pilgrims of Orum’s Dream to compare hymnals and the rib-song you hear.\",\n        \"Deliver the completed chart to Yhosa Kel and log a copy with Brinelaw for public use.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yhosa Kel\", \"lines\": \"I have shaped bone for thirty years, Kestrel, and I have learned this much: a city must never forget what it stands upon, nor presume the bones will forgive our inattention. The ribs carry us still, and when they sing, we would be fools not to listen, for the song is warning and welcome together. Take this lacquered chart and this bearing cup; they are patient listeners, but they will not abide a lie, and if you feign a note the lacquer will craze like ice at first thaw and ruin all our work. You will find three true resonances or none at all, and if none, then the truth of absence is the truth we need, not the comfort of invention. Bring me those three notes and I will set buttresses where the song says we may stand, and I will argue before Brinelaw and the Compact both that the city’s safety is written in music older than ledgers.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Siala Nerm\", \"lines\": \"We sing to the ribs to remember we are guests in another’s body, and guests who forget themselves break chairs and hearts alike. If the song you gather tastes of sorrow, do not sweeten it with hope, for false honey clouds the water and the drowned cannot sip. If it tastes of anger, do not cut it with reason, for reason has the courtesy of a ladder but the tide has the strength of a storm, and neither loves being told how to behave. Let it be what it is and you will know where not to tread, and perhaps you will hear where Orum dreams and where Orum aches. When you return, bring your notes to our hymnals, and we will set them beside the old verses, and together we will decide whether the city moves with a sleeping heart or against it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Garrik Shale\", \"lines\": \"My riggers will be at the surface with lines if the eddies get teeth in you, and they will not sleep while you are below. Signal once for slack, twice for strain, thrice for steel, and we will haul you out hard enough to shame the tide, because I have no patience for reverence that forgets lungs need air. If the Pilgrims start turning this work into a procession, I’ll cut their candles to stubs with my glare alone, then we will talk about hymns when you’re warm and dry. I respect a hymn as much as any mother’s lullaby, but I will not lose another hand to devotion, not after the Night of Unmoored Chains taught us what iron does when prayer is louder than inspection. You keep your head clear, your lines tidy, and your ears open, and I’ll keep the Array turning slow and safe until you bring back something even the Compact can grasp without dropping.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Kestrel\", \"lines\": \"I’ll map what the water tells me and I won’t flinch from a sour note, because a sour note is a true one and I’ve no taste for lies varnished as favor. The ribs and I have an understanding: I tread light and listen hard, and in return they let me pass through their choir without taking my breath as tithe. If there’s a crack in the city’s song the lacquer will show it, and if there’s a hidden harmony it will settle into these grooves like dawn into still water. I’ll take the Pilgrims’ verses to heart without letting them drown the data, and I’ll keep the Chainmasters’ lines close without letting them haul me out before I’m done. When I come back, you’ll have the truth, and Brinelaw will have a copy no oath-breaker can plead ignorance over, and then we’ll see who wants to argue with the sea’s own handwriting.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Fold the Survey into a Vigil\", \"text\": \"Mara invites Dreamwarden Siala Nerm and her candlelit flotilla to pace the skiff, and times each sounding to the rise and fall of their whale-song. She opens the bearing cup to the hymn’s edge and lets the water vibrate against the lacquer while the candles throw amber commas across the ribs. Instead of rushing for three swift marks, she lingers at each hollow until the resonance deepens, allowing a chorus of overtones to etch subtle crosshatches into the chart. Garrik’s riggers grumble at the slower schedule, but Mara steadies them with crisp signals and the promise of clear, shared data. When a mirage-current tries to mimic a true note near the second rib, she orders the Pilgrims to pause their chant, listens for the quiet that remains, and refuses to record silence masquerading as song.\", \"outcome\": \"The chart returns richer, with three primary resonance points and faint cautionary veils where hymn and hollow disagree, and Yhosa studies it with the hungry calm of a craftsman who has found both permission and restraint. The Pilgrims speak her name with approval for letting the song lead rather than the clock, and Siala promises future verses if the bones change again. Garrik is irritated but grudgingly impressed that no line tangled, and he admits the data will save hands, even if it cost him patience. The Anchor-Compact’s clerks sniff at the delays, but Brinelaw appreciates the rigor; Osric Greyfen notes in the ledger that the public copy includes Pilgrim addenda and that the record will stand. Mara senses she has won gentler passage through Pilgrim waters and marked herself as a listener first, but she has also lit a small coal of envy in those who move cargo by schedules and not by song.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Run a Tight Chainmaster Survey\", \"text\": \"Mara establishes a crisp cadence with Garrik’s riggers and sets a strict window at low tide, using hand-signs and rope tugs to keep the skiff arrowed through the ribs. She informs Siala Nerm that consultation will happen after the initial pass and asks the Pilgrims to hold clear until the first three marks are recorded without ceremonial pause. At each rib, she braces the cup, takes three identical readings, and rejects any that show the flicker of eddy-echo, building a clean triad of notes with engineer’s precision. When a squeeze current shoulders the skiff near the third rib, she cuts the grapnel loose and rides the slipstream out rather than risking a tangle in bone-lace. Only when the data is secure does she dock by the candles, unfold the lacquered grooves for Siala to inspect, and invite comparison—without ceding authorship of the survey’s spine.\", \"outcome\": \"The chart is clean and assertive, a navigational spine that the Chainmaster’s Union praises for clarity and repeatability, and Garrik stamps his mark in grease upon the copy with a rare nod. Yhosa appreciates the decisiveness and begins sketching load paths for future buttressing, noting that the grooves carry few ambiguities and will please conservative benches at Brinelaw. The Pilgrims bristle at being relegated to an after-song, but Siala’s critique is thoughtful; two of her hymnal lines align and one conflicts, and Mara adds a modest caution glyph at that point. The Anchor-Compact tallies the lack of delay as a quiet point in Mara’s favor, while Brinelaw records the consultation as adequate if brisk. In private, Mara knows the bones spoke louder when she moved softer, but the city often needs a firm path it can teach to apprentices and helmsmen who do not hear as she does.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Take a Shadowed Line Between the Notes\", \"text\": \"On the way to the shoals, a familiar skiff ghosting under the bluffs hails Mara with a lantern-cough, and a Ribshadow runner offers an old wrecker’s whisper: a narrow channel that hums at neap-tide and carries sound like a pipe. She weighs the risk, tastes the Oathwell salt at her throat, and accepts the tip without promising more than a share of truth later. Threading the secret line, she feels the bones sing a shiver of counterpoint, a fourth resonance that the public channels would never have revealed, a note tucked into the city’s ribs like a hidden ache. She records the three required points by the book, then lets the fourth etch itself faintly in a place only careful eyes will notice—a notation of potential, not an invitation. When she returns, she consults the Pilgrims openly and logs the formal copy with Brinelaw, and only in the margin of Yhosa’s private draft does she point to the sliver of music that might become a salvage-safe corridor if handled with reverence.\", \"outcome\": \"The official chart stands complete and compliant, and Yhosa’s brows lift at the private annotation that suggests a latent path for boats that need night lanes where the ribs do not cut. Brinelaw accepts the public copy and Osric Greyfen’s quill hesitates, perhaps sensing that more was heard than was written, but the ink dries on a lawful record nonetheless. The Pilgrims are divided: some call the hidden note a mercy for wrecker families, others a temptation for greed, and Siala asks Mara quietly to promise that any use of it will keep candles lit and cutters sheathed. Garrik, hearing only that the data is solid, returns to his Array with confidence, unaware that a new thread hums beneath the city’s busy loom. Meanwhile the Ribshadow Brotherhood counts the lanterns by the lighthouse and decides that Mara repaid a debt with discretion rather than coin, a currency that lasts longer and binds deeper.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M2\"], \"next\": [\"M4\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Resonance Chart of the Whispering Ribs (improves safe navigation)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Equipment Upgrade\", \"description\": \"Bow-limb reinforcement from Bonewrights’ Collegium (+stability in wet)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"+Favor with Bonewrights’ Collegium (Yhosa Kel)\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Renown\", \"description\": \"Public credit recorded at Brinelaw (minor reputation)\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
