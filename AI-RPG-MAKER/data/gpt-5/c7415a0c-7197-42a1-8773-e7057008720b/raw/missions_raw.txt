Matron Selka Vire and High Bailiff Osric Greyfen convene the Anchor-Compact, the guilds, and the Pilgrims to hear what Mara carried back from the Trench. Bonewright banners hang heavy; Chainmasters stand with arms like posts; the Rime-Lanterns burn their cold fire with quiet pride; the Pilgrims hold the Scale as if it were an oath made flesh. The question is not whether Orum’s heart stirs, but what Dorsalhaven will do when it does. Bind the city tighter to the seabed with law and iron and hymns? Loosen the chains and trust to compacts made in public instead of in fear? In the hall, an old meteor-iron link hums under the speaker’s dais, and rumors say it makes cautious men more cautious still. Mara’s voice, backed by charts and shards and songs, must set the course. And when the Oathwell’s brine bites her tongue one last time, she will speak the chain she means to carry, and the one she means to cut.\",\"objectives\":[\"Present the Resonance Chart, the humming shard, and the Heart-Scale or recorded pulse to the council at the Anchor-King’s Hall.\",\"Argue for a Brinelaw amendment recognizing independent outrider charters bound by public oaths rather than Compact debt-bonds.\",\"Propose a balanced protocol: shared marrow safety, Pilgrim moratoriums on holy nights, and Chainmaster veto on risky expansions.\",\"Defuse Neth Cowl’s attempt to derail the vote with a scandal or a leak; offer him a lawful lane that keeps wrecker families fed without knives at chains.\",\"Seal the decision at the Oathwell with a brine oath that binds you and the city to the chosen course.\"],\"dialogue\":[{\"speaker\":\"Selka Vire\",\"lines\":\"You have brought me more than proof; you have brought me possibility.
