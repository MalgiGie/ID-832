Along the Dorsal Span the wind combs kelp-silk into streaming pennons, bone-lace balconies glitter with rime-lantern frost, and the rib-arches ring like struck goblets as the city dresses itself in salt and song. Pilgrims in sea-grey mantles lift veiled reliquaries on poles of whittled bone, their whale-song harmonies gliding beneath the clatter of tram-carts and the gossip of gulls that circle the jaw. Brinelaw bailiffs chalk tide marks around the oath-stalls and test their whistles against the throb of the crowd, while Chainmaster crews squat beneath the Span to listen for sour notes in the long bones’ hum where cracked braces wait like frayed rope. Rumor runs faster than the procession: that Siala Nerm will lift the veil on a legendary Heart-Scale before all, that the Anchor-Compact will see their ledgers drown under a wave of awe, that cutters and saboteurs lurk with moon-iron ready to make the city’s song a scream. You, Mara Kestrel, bear your bow and a scroll of rib-song figures called the Resonance Chart, inked with the mathematics of tide and bone and breath. If the ribs begin to thrum heavy, the chart will tell you where the crowd must loosen, where an arch will sing itself toward fracture, and where one arrow shot into silence could become a bell loud enough to turn a thousand feet. When the first prayer-banners appear over the rise—salt-white, kelp-green, marrow-blue—the air turns cold and clean, and somewhere deep in the skeleton underfoot, something answers in a pulse slow as winter. Whether that beat is dream or sabotage, whether the city rises like a choir or shatters like glass on rock, will rest on how you walk the Span and which voice you choose to carry to the heart of the crowd.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Guard the procession along the Dorsal Span and watch for saboteurs at key choke points and oath-stalls.\",\n        \"Coordinate with Brinelaw bailiffs to reroute crowds if stampede risk increases; use the Resonance Chart to anticipate dangerous rhythms.\",\n        \"Decide whether to support Siala’s unveiling of the Heart-Scale publicly or urge a private audience at the Anchor-King’s Hall.\",\n        \"Prevent a deliberate chain cut beneath the Span from causing a collapse; apprehend the culprits if possible.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Siala Nerm\", \"lines\": \"If we hide our heart for fear of greed, we make a tomb of our city, and we salt it with our own doubts until nothing grows. I will unveil the Scale because the living deserve a true song, and because the dead do not ask us to whisper when we can sing. You know the Span as a hunter knows a ridge, Mara Kestrel; if you walk beside our banners, I will trust your hand to make space where awe will press like tide against rock. I do not ask you to believe as I do, only to listen for the beat beneath the noise, and give it room to be heard without crushing the small or the slow. Stand with me and I will owe you a debt I will not repay with words alone, but with shelter when storm comes, with Pilgrim hands when yours grow tired, and with a promise that I will not spend your courage for spectacle. Stand against me, and I will still sing for your safe road home, and I will sit with you after in the Cathedral’s hush to hear why your fear has more weight than my hope, and I will not call you faithless for fearing the crush of a crowd. If the Scale proves false, hold me publicly to the Brinelaw for deceiving hearts, for I will have deceived my own as well; but if it proves true, let us not chain the moment under ledgers and locks lest the song sour in the throat. The heart of a city is like brine in a bowl—left covered too long, it grows still and stale; lifted to the air, it stings and brightens and wakes the tongue. Help me lift it, and we will taste who we are without flinching.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Selka Vire\", \"lines\": \"This city survives because it picks its moments the way a seasoned captain picks a channel in a storm—no sudden turns, no shallow bravado, and no surrender to the romance of a perfect wave. If the Scale exists, show it to me in council, not in a crowd that drinks and surges and mistakes awe for permission, because awe loosens hands and makes men think the rules have stepped aside. I will not have a revelation stamped into a riot to be tallied as a tariff loss, a ledger of broken ribs and trampled children written in the same ink as harbor dues. Bring it to the Anchor-King’s Hall, to the dais where even courage answers to caution, and let Brinelaw witness so no one calls the moment a trick or a theft. I do not forbid hope, Mara; I cage it long enough to fit it with a harness, and then I let it pull the city without kicking it to pieces. Help me keep order and I will keep the Compact’s hand light upon your debt, and I will add a voucher to your name so your next convoy sails with no coin demanded at the gate. Defy me and win the crowd, and I will nod and say the city chose its song, but understand that I will count each consequence and send the bill to those who made it ring. You came to the Hall with brine on your tongue once before; if you counsel prudence today, I will remember it when others call me a coward for not chasing the chorus. Choose the hall over the street, and prove to me that the strongest song is one that does not need to drown the listener to be heard.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Osric Greyfen\", \"lines\": \"I can widen the route, post bailiffs at the ribs that creak, and make space for wonder that does not crush children underfoot, but only if you tell me where the bones sing wrong and the crowd will flow like a river into a narrow mouth. If anyone reaches for a chain with cutters in their hands, I will have them in irons before the fourth bell, and I will put my own oath in the Oathwell if my men fail to make that promise true. Give me your eyes where my men cannot see—above the lantern-glare, along the lace-balconies, and beneath the Span where shadows learn to walk like men with quiet knives. I do not care about the Scale’s truth; I care about weight, timing, and the way fear leaps from one face to a thousand when a sound shifts by a single note, so lend me that Resonance Chart and I will trust your finger when it taps danger on the parchment. If the song goes heavy, we will loosen the press with whistles and rope-barricades, and we will break the procession into singing islands so it can breathe without drowning itself. Should the worst come, I will open the side thoroughfares and route families through the market teeth to bleed pressure into the harbor breeze, and I expect you to guide the first stream through before panic decides their feet for them. You have a bow and the right calm; if you fire, fire to aim the crowd, not to punish it, and know that Brinelaw will stand in front of those arrows if I judge the angle wrong. Bring me saboteurs alive if you can, names if you cannot, and I will put those names under tide and lantern until ink yields truth. Walk with us and we will bear the weight together; leave us blind and I will not forgive it, even if the Cathedral forgives you with songs.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Garrik Shale\", \"lines\": \"Two braces under the Span are cracked and waiting for an excuse, and an excuse under a singing crowd is one breath and a footfall away from an obituary. If the song goes heavy, you steer the people away, and you do it with a whistle, a banner, a shout pitched to the ribs, or an arrow through a drum if the drummers won’t hear reason. I don’t care who carries a Scale or a ledger today; I care that the Tidemill Array doesn’t have to slow for funerals tomorrow and that my crews don’t spend the next week swapping out shattered links while the Compact counts blessings. I’ve got riggers posted with wedges and braces, and a coil team under the Span ready to throw counterweight if the hum drops to a killing note, but I need someone above who can read a crowd like a line under strain. Put your ear to Orum if you must, but keep your eyes on boots and elbows, because bones don’t kill crowds—crowds kill crowds when they turn to look at a miracle and forget to breathe. Bring me a saboteur and I’ll give you a nod; stop a chain cut and I’ll put your name on a safety seal and dare the Brinelaw to argue with the Union’s mark. You were raised on these bones; prove it by knowing when to tell a thousand hearts to step left at once and make them want to obey you. If anyone blames you for shouting, tell them Garrik Shale ordered it, and I’ll take the heat with a voice they can’t ignore. This procession ends with everyone walking home or not at all, and I’d rather be cursed for being loud than mourned for being polite.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Kestrel\", \"lines\": \"I will walk the ribs and the crowd with the same care I use to cross a wet spar in a squall, and I will count my breaths against the hum in the bones until I hear the seam where safety tears. If the Scale shows, I will make the space for it the way a pilot makes water for a turning hull, slow at first and then with a sure hand, and I will let awe pass like wind without letting it become a gale. If a hand goes for a chain, I will put an arrow between the hand and the iron, and I will choose the angle that teaches without maiming, because fear is a blunt tool and I would rather carve than bludgeon. My chart speaks in numbers, but I have learned that numbers are only another way to spell the word listen, and I will listen to the ribs, to the whistles, and to the hush that drops a crowd before a surge. I have debts to both song and ledger, and I will not let either spend the lives of people I know by name because pride wanted the last word. If we take the Scale to the Hall I will walk before it like a masthead, and if we raise it under the open sky I will walk beside it like a tide-guide, and in both cases I will keep an arrow for anyone who mistakes revelation for permission to cut. I want this city to hear its own heart and choose its chains, not wear them because fear says they are the only things that hold us up. I will answer for my choices at the Oathwell if it comes to that, but first I will make choices that keep children on their feet and old men with enough breath to sing the next verse. Tell me where you want the first lane opened, and I will open it with a shout that threads the ribs cleanly and sets feet moving like a tide. Then, when the song lifts or the silence breaks, we will see which story we chose and live with it together.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Lift the Veil in the Open Air\", \"text\": \"You stride to Siala’s side as the banners crest the Span and raise your bow over your head, not as a threat but as a mast that marks the wind, and the nearest bailiffs take their cue from your stance. You unfurl the Resonance Chart in the lantern-light and point to the places where sound pools heavy, then thread ahead of the reliquary with a whistle note flat enough to undercut the clamor and make people breathe. Your voice goes out in clean commands—step left, leave a lane, hold your children high—and you sell obedience with the easy authority of someone who knows how bones sing and when they might crack. At your signal, drummers soften their strikes and the Pilgrims widen their spacing, islanding the procession so awe has room to expand without turning into a crush that folds itself inward. When Siala lifts the veil and the Heart-Scale spills a dim, living glow like winter moon through deep water, you make eye contact with the men watching the chain anchors and they see you watching them, arrow nocked, and they look away with their cutters lowered.\", \"outcome\": \"The crowd inhales as one, but the breath does not become a scream or a surge; it becomes a held chord that steadies when your whistle tells it how long to last, and then it is released into cheers that ripple rather than pound. Two saboteurs try the chain beneath the third arch, but your arrow bites the link they mean to free and rings like a bell, and Osric’s men are already moving because you gave him the rhythm three heartbeats earlier. Garrik’s riggers wedge the cracked brace, the hum lifts into safety, and you divert the closest press through the Market of Teeth where old Kera’s omen-tooth weeps and then dries as if satisfied by restraint. Pilgrims surround you with salt-wet eyes, Siala presses brine to your brow and calls you the hand that made room for the city’s own pulse, and you feel the simple warmth of public gratitude soaking into your name. Selka Vire does not smile, but she does not throw a shadow over the moment either; she sends a clerk later with a tightly folded voucher and a note that reads, pay your duties with this and keep your arrows for the next time a song needs a spine.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Counsel the Anchor-King’s Hall\", \"text\": \"Before the reliquary clears the first oath-stall, you step into Siala’s path with a hand up and your voice low, and you ask her to trust you as you have trusted her to sing over your mistakes. You point to the Resonance Chart and trace with your finger the places where the hum will drop, show her how the Hall will cradle a revelation without asking the city to gamble its bones on a perfect moment, and promise that the choice to wait is not fear but stewardship. You make the case in the language she understands—ritual and witness—and you offer to be the banner-bearer who leads the Scale through the side lanes to the dais, with Brinelaw to bind the moment so no faction can call it theft. You walk then to Selka Vire’s messenger and deliver the plan with a firm chin, and you do not bow but you do not posture, either; you speak like someone who has walked debt and dream and found a middle that holds. When murmurs in the crowd begin to wobble into restlessness, you stand on a bone-plinth and announce in a clear, carrying voice that the unveiling will happen under the Hall’s banners before the tide turns, and you tell the mothers and the elders that they will get to see it without being ground by the crowd, and thousands of shoulders unclench at the thought of air and seats and order.\", \"outcome\": \"Siala takes a long breath and then nods, grief and resolve wrestling in her face before settling into the dignity of a promise kept to the living, and she turns the reliquary toward the Anchor-King’s Hall with hymn and drum dialing down to a pilgrim’s march. Osric’s bailiffs unfurl ropes to guide the crowd into ribbons, and while some jeer about cowardice, most are relieved to trade rumor for certainty, and the pressure drains from the Span like water through a scupper. Beneath the Span, two figures with cutters find their timing ruined by the shift, and Garrik’s coil team hauls them into the light; you stand above and mark their faces for Brinelaw ledgers. In the Hall, the Scale is unveiled to magistrates and merchants alike, and even Selka’s practiced caution cannot keep her eyes from widening as the dim glow seems to slow the room’s breath; she signs a voucher for your harbor dues with a dry quip about paying debts on time, and she notes in her private ledger that you traded a riot for a ritual. The Pilgrims still grant you their blessing, though some sing you the minor key of patience instead of the major cry of triumph, and you accept it without flinching; later, Siala invites you to examine the Scale up close under watch, and whispers that sometimes a heart needs a ribcage to be heard clearly.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Marshal the Span and Hunt the Cutters\", \"text\": \"You thread away from the reliquary and drop into the work instead of the wonder, shoulders brushing the rope-rails as you speak in quick knots of instruction to Brinelaw whistles and Union riggers. The Resonance Chart rides your palm, and you call out three adjustments in the first minute—drummers to soften, pilgrims to stagger by fours, vendors to shutter a stall to open a lung for the crowd—so the pressure never gets the chance to stack and turn ugly. You plant yourself above the third arch where the crack hides like a split under lacquer, and you watch bootlines the way a hunter watches a treeline, waiting for a foot that hovers one fraction of a beat too long. When you catch it—the hitch, the downward glance, the hand that pats a wrapped tool—you move, not with a shout but with a swiftness that puts you at the rib-edge with arrow drawn, and the man who thought the hum would cover his cutters finds himself staring at a moon-iron tip that promises he’ll be marking ledgers with his left hand forever if he blinks wrong. You do not grandstand; you hand him to Osric’s bailiffs, lean down to listen to the ribs, and signal Garrik to set his wedges as you tilt the crowd with two sharp commands that flow through the Span like a firm tide.\", \"outcome\": \"The sabotage never takes, not because there were no saboteurs but because they never find the silence they need to act; you keep the music of the crowd slightly off the obvious beat, just enough to shake certainty from dirty hands. Brinelaw hauls three culprits into daylight, names get written into wet ledgers with Oathwell brine stinging tongues that try to lie, and the rumor of sabotage cracks and dissolves under the weight of arrests made without blood. The procession completes as a slow, safe braid of bodies and banners, and the unveiling—whether deferred or diminished—matters less than the fact that the city learned to walk together without treading anyone under. Garrik claps you on the shoulder hard enough to bruise and mutters that if more archers knew the span of a breath, fewer chains would sing the song no one wants to hear, and Osric nods once in a way that means he will remember your name when writs are written. You still earn the public’s thanks and the Pilgrims’ blessing for keeping the way open, and Selka’s clerk, ever practical, slips you the harbor-dues voucher with a dry remark that the best miracle is a day that ends with everyone alive and on time; later, you are invited to examine the Heart-Scale under watch because those who kept order are owed the courtesy of wonder.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Parley in the Shadows with Old Debts\", \"text\": \"You cut across the Span and drop to the shadow lanes along the rib-lace where the whispers walk, your reefcloak drinking the lantern-glow until you are only a motion between railings and chimes. You find a lookout with a wrecker’s scar at the Salt Widow’s mark stitched into his cuff, and you murmur the cant you learned under the bluffs, letting your old debt to Neth Cowl show like a knuckle bared but not clenched. You make a bargain in plain words: the Pilgrims get their walk without a broken link, and the Brotherhood gets a clean night on the next fog with two Brinelaw patrols conveniently routed wide by the very chart that guides the procession today, and you swear it on a sip from your Oathwell phial so he knows you will bleed a little if you lie. He leans, listens, and finally nods because he is not paid to martyrdom and because he knows your aim was steady the night his lookout almost gave you up and you let him live. You return to the Span with a new thread woven into the day’s fabric: the men who would have cut for coin will cut themselves out of the picture, and the men who want the city to shatter for politics will find their tools missing and their hands suddenly empty.\", \"outcome\": \"The saboteurs you expected never appear at the arch where the hum dips; they wait, then drift away when their shadow-brokers do not arrive with the gear and the timing, and the crowd breathes through its dangerous points with the help of your whistle and Osric’s ropes. The procession carries, the unveiling happens where and how you or your allies decide, and either way the result is a day without bodies on stretchers and a night without revenge-blood in the market drains. Brinelaw frowns at the gaps in their patrol logs and files a note to speak with you, but Osric chooses not to look too hard at the timing when he sees the safety of the outcome and the ink of the Oathwell still wet on your tongue. The Brotherhood passes a quiet word that you squared an old account without selling out the docks to the Compact, and while it does not pay coin, it buys you half a dozen ears that will turn your way when you need them. Public thanks still finds you—Pilgrims with salt-knots, mothers with tired smiles—and Selka’s voucher still arrives because the Compact values results above provenance; later, under careful watch, you lay your palm on the Heart-Scale and listen for a beat that sounds like the city forgiving itself for one more day.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M9\"], \"next\": [\"M11\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Renown\", \"description\": \"Public gratitude and a Pilgrim blessing, granting clearer readings of sea omens and a steadier hand when listening for the city’s song.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Voucher\", \"description\": \"Anchor-Compact voucher waiving harbor dues on one convoy, stamped in brine and ledger-ink for unquestioned passage.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Faction\", \"description\": \"+Favor with Pilgrims if the Heart-Scale is unveiled safely in public, or +Favor with the Anchor-Compact if you counsel a private reveal at the Anchor-King’s Hall.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Permission to examine the Heart-Scale up close under watch, to study its glow and the hum that moves through bone when it lies near.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
