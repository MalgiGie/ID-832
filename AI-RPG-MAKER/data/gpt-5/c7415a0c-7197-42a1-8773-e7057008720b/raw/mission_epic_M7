Irio Mossvane leaned against a rib rail scarred by old wind, his fingers reading the grain the way a navigator reads a chart, and he nodded to Mara Kestrel as if greeting a tide he had long expected to turn. The charter in his oilskin case bore three waxes and four grudges: Bonewrights and Rime-Lanterns had pooled coin and caution, while the Pilgrims had offered a hymn in place of a seal and a warning in place of a threat. Beyond the chain-gates lay the coral labyrinth of Nareth, where questions nested like sparrows in reef-hollows and sang themselves into the mind that dared to pry; the Library did not keep books but knots of inquiry, and each knot, when unsealed with a true voice, would spill a memory belonging to no one and everyone. The plan was simple as a drawn bow and just as treacherous: hop the coast within the shelter of basalt teeth, listen for trick currents that looped a vessel back to the same inlet, sing the Pilgrims’ opening verse, and go with hands that promised not to cut. But the reef had its own defenders, green-black serpents as old as moonlight on tide, and they bowed to no flag or ledger, only to presence and patience; harm one and the Library’s song soured for a year, or so the Shell-Scribes had warned in their vanishing tongue. The sliver of coral secreted under Mara’s bow-grip warmed like a tiny heart against her palm, thrumming a rhythm she had once heard in a Pilgrim vigil and in the water below Fathomfall’s rim, and she knew that whatever lay ahead already knew her name. The Anchor-Compact looked outward with eager teeth, the guilds sharpened quills or knives inside their sleeves, and Brinelaw’s stones were salt-slick with petitions; yet the sea did not care for signatures, only for balance and song. So Mara took her place at the prow under a waxed reefcloak, the rime-lantern hooded, her pressure-kelp fletched arrows quiet in their quiver, and let Irio’s gestures call the wind like old friends to guide them into the rose and antler maze where questions grew like living flame.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\"Sail by coastal hops to the Coral Library of Nareth with Irio’s guidance, avoiding trick currents.\", \"Sing the opening verse taught by Pilgrims to unseal a question-knot; retrieve a memory that belongs to no one and everyone.\", \"Evade or pacify a territorial reef-serpent without killing it; preserve the Library’s living coral.\", \"Return fragments of Shell-Scribe technique or hymn to Yhosa Kel and Pera Ilem, and share a Pilgrim-approved copy for the Reliquary.\"],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Irio Mossvane\", \"lines\": \"I’ve seen storms that breathe easier than this dock, and the air-moss is puffing like a beast that has just scented something it both fears and loves. Hear that hum under your boots, Mara; the towers talk to us when the wind sharpens into a wire, and today they sing of tricky loops and false welcomes hidden in bright water. We will not fight the currents at Nareth, we will court them, letting the boat fall into their arms like a dancer who trusts the floor, because the Library hates swagger and rewards those who listen. Keep your rime-lantern shuttered unless I say, because the lantern-fish here are vain and will chase their own reflections until they die, and the reef-serpents will follow light as if it were a challenge flung at their coils. If the Library asks you something, don’t answer with pride, because pride tastes to the coral like marrow boiled too hot and it will close itself against you for a tide and a day. Remember that the questions it releases stick to the tongue like salt-candy and pull at the heart like undertow, and the only way not to drown is to name what you carry and share it before it ferments. We thread reefs like we thread quarrels through your bow, slow and precise and with no waste, and we leave wakes that look like apologies written in foam.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yhosa Kel\", \"lines\": \"We will not cut living coral, and I say it twice so that the words lay like twin braces beneath our purpose, because the first time is for the ear and the second for the hand. Coral is bone’s cousin in this city, a patient architect of lattices that endure beyond the season of any one craftsperson, and to carve it while it lives is to unteach ourselves what we claim to be building toward. What I seek are Shell-Scribe ways to lace bone with living forms without harm, patterns that invite growth rather than impose it, so that arches breathe and bearings sing with the sea instead of against it. Bring me the method of asking—how to sing the small songs that guide a reef to embrace a strut, how to polish without scouring, how to prepare bone so the coral chooses to kiss it—and I will call you colleague before all the Collegium. If a reef-serpent tests you, know that it is the Library’s hand in scale and muscle, and you must show it that your oar is a reed and your knife a vow not drawn, because to kill would make us clever thieves and nothing more. When you return, I will not ask for trophies but for the humility to say what you do not know, and for the patience to let what you learned change the next thing you make.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pera Ilem\", \"lines\": \"The rumor of a cooling hymn that stills marrow without biting the blood has outlived three generations of careful lies and one generation of accidental truths, and I am tired of having to choose which mask to wear when a child coughs blue light. If there is a counterphrase hidden in those coral knots that eases the boil in a crucible and damps the jump of volatile flame, bring me even its bones, and I will carve the flesh back on with work and sleeplessness. Know this and carry it like a sealed phial in your chest: I will not trade safety for spectacle, and I will not see another lamplighter’s hands turn glass-pale because we pursued a legend like gulls chasing a wake. The Pilgrims hate the word plague in our mouths, but hate will not keep night-dark alleys lit or keep thieves from taking advantage of fear, so we must be sober in our asking and exact in our singing. Do not let any man or myth hurry you; haste in the Library is heat in a crucible, and either one will crack you if you do not respect the conditions. When you return, bring me a phrase that cools without stealing warmth from a human hand, even if it is only the shape of the pause between two notes, because sometimes it is the silence that saves us.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Siala Nerm\", \"lines\": \"The Library keeps questions the way the sea keeps promises, tucked into folds and hidden gullies, revealed only when the light strikes at the right angle and the heart remembers to be small. You will go as a guest or you will not go at all, and that is not a threat but the truth of holy places that are also alive, and I say holy even though the word is out of favor because it fits what breathes there. I will teach you the opening verse, a hush-chant that asks leave to enter and asks leave to leave, and I will teach you the matching silence, because an answer without a silence to hold it spills and stains like oil. When you feel the coral’s attention press like a hand on your brow, ask a true question without bargaining, and when it gives you a memory not yours, do not clutch it as coin but lift it like a lantern where others can warm their hands. If a serpent rises, show it your empty palm and the Oathwell phial at your neck, and taste the brine so that your promise has a witness older than the Compact, because some oaths are spoken to scales and stone and they bind more tightly than paper. Bring back song if song is given, but bring back also the restraint to say this much is not ours, and I will make space for the verse in the Reliquary alongside the quiet that keeps it from burning us.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Kestrel\", \"lines\": \"I hear the air-moss hum and it sounds like a line drawn taut between two duties, and I have walked lines all my life with my boots finding purchase where a sensible soul would crawl. I’ll tread light as kelp-shadow, ask true as a gull’s arc, and leave more living than I found, because I have no taste for a city that eats its own cousins to stay upright. The coral shard under my bow hums to the same note you set in my chest with your words, and I will not pretend it does not know me, but I will not let its knowing turn me greedy. If the Library presses a memory into my hands, I will hold it like a tideglass compass—look long enough to steer by it and then set it down where others can see the shimmer, because direction is only good if everyone can use it. I will face the serpent like I face the men who think a ledger is a leash, with my bow lowered and my gaze steady, and if I must spend breath to cool what boils or sing to unseal a question, I will, and then I will make sure the silence travels with the song so it does not corrode our lives.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Sing Only the Hush-Path\", \"text\": \"Mara chooses to cleave strictly to the Pilgrims’ hush-verse and its matching silence, letting Irio set a pace that honors the reef’s breath instead of the charter’s clock. She keeps the rime-lantern shuttered until the water itself asks for light, and when the reef-serpent rises like a threshold given muscle, she places her palm flat upon the sea and tastes brine from the Oathwell phial so that her promise has witness. At the Library’s lip she sings the opening measure and then waits, counting heartbeats until the coral’s song leans toward her like a door that opens inward, and only then does she ask a question that is honest and small. Her bow remains a reed across her knees, and the coral shard under its grip hums but does not lead, because she refuses to press an advantage that the living maze did not grant. Every step of the retrieval is a negotiation with patience, a conversation with currents, and she takes only a memory that flows into her cupped hands without scrape or bruise.\", \"outcome\": \"The serpent tastes her breath and sways away, accepting the proof of oath and the absence of challenge, and the water smooths as if a hand had stroked it flat. The Library unseals a question-knot that spills an old shipwright’s memory of teaching bone to grow with coral, and in that memory is the gentlest of Shell-Scribe techniques—an invitation rather than a cut—which Yhosa Kel later deciphers without a single living head harmed. A faint counterphrase rides in the tail of the song like cool mist over glass, and Pera Ilem recognizes it as a cadence that eases marrow boil without leeching warmth, though it requires measured breath and is slower than her rivals would like. Siala Nerm receives a faithful copy of the hush-verse paired to the pause that frames it, and she threads it into the Reliquary with a smile that is more relief than triumph. Favor tilts toward the Pilgrims for the care taken, while Bonewrights and Rime-Lanterns respect the results if not the tempo, and Mara’s name carries a quiet weight among those who heed living boundaries.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Broker the Threefold Ask\", \"text\": \"Mara arranges a pale-coral sandbar summit beneath the shadow of an antler-crown coral, inviting Irio, a Bonewright journeyman sworn to Yhosa’s quota ledgers, and a careful Rime-Lantern adept carrying Pera’s seal to speak before the reef listens. She lays down her bow and her knife upon a coil of salt-hemp line and swears in brine that no living head will be cut, no serpent will be harmed, and every verse learned will be shared in matched halves—one for craft, one for keep. With the serpent circling like a punctuation mark that never lands, Mara proposes a technique of taking that is not taking at all: they will sing only to what the Library releases freely, record in tideglass, and leave an offering of labor by patching a storm-snarled coral lattice with their hands alone. She asks the Library not for materials but for process, not for privilege but for a way to ask again without diminishing what is asked, and she ties each promise to a knot in the line so every word has a fiber holding it fast. The coral shard under her bow hums in approval when she ignores its pull to shortcuts, and the air about them settles as if the reef itself has set its terms and found them fit.\", \"outcome\": \"The reef-serpent glides close enough that its eye is all the world, then rests its jaw in the water beside the coil of knots as if to weigh their truth, and after a long count it sinks without a ripple, sanctioning the pact in the only way that matters here. The Library opens a question-knot that contains twin streams: a Shell-Scribe pattern of coral-lacing that teaches bone to welcome living overgrowth without piercing it, and a marrow-cooling counterphrase tuned to the rhythm of careful hands rather than roaring furnaces. Yhosa Kel receives a fragment that his Collegium can test with resin and patience, adding strength and grace without harm, while Pera Ilem gains a spoken cadence that lowers volatility when paired with precise timing and a lamplighter’s steady lungs. Siala Nerm accepts a Pilgrim-approved copy of both verse and silence sealed together, and she binds them with reef-twine in the Reliquary so no line is sundered from its restraint. The outcome balances favor among Bonewrights, Rime-Lanterns, and Pilgrims, with Irio’s esteem for Mara deepening into something like trust that does not require coin, and Brinelaw’s far-off stones feel cooler when the petitions they later receive read as accords instead of demands.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Consult the Hidden Shard\", \"text\": \"Mara kneels at the boat’s prow when the currents begin to circle back, and she presses her thumb to the sliver of coral hidden beneath her bow’s grip, feeling its hum rise through bone and tendon like a second pulse. She asks the shard in a whisper whether the Library will hear the voice of its own fragment, and in the pause before the answer she recognizes the risk of asking anything that can answer too quickly. She does not let the shard lead, but she lets it translate, tuning her breath to a subsonic measure that vibrates across the reef without jarring it, like a hand smoothing a wrinkled chart rather than forcing it flat. When the serpent lifts, she holds its gaze with a stillness learned on ropewalks and places the bow across her knees so it becomes a bridge instead of a weapon, and she names aloud the debts she carries so there are no shadows to startle. The shard’s counsel points to a quieter inlet where the Library’s questions loosen like knots in warm water, and she enters there, singing not louder but truer to a pitch that seems to come from the coral more than from her own chest.\", \"outcome\": \"The reef-serpent draws close enough to feel the push of its breath ripple Mara’s cloak, then eases aside as if it, too, has heard a familiar kin-voice sounding from the bow, and it coils as a boundary rather than a threat. The Library releases a memory that runs like clear water: a Shell-Scribe demonstration of aligning bone lattices to a living coral’s growth rhythm so that coral chooses to settle and strengthen rather than be scraped and forced, which Yhosa Kel later calls a kindness turned into architecture. A marrow-cooling counterphrase arrives in the aftersong, delicate and exacting, and Pera Ilem notes that it must never be shouted across a busy floor but spoken into a crucible’s mouth like a lullaby, and if honored, it averts flare without biting the lamplighter’s blood. Siala Nerm senses the shard’s part in the asking and insists upon a matching silence be taught with the verse, and Mara agrees, offering a copy that avoids any command-tone that could grow into coercion, which the Reliquary accepts with solemn chime. Favor comes to Mara in even measure from Irio, the Bonewrights, and the Rime-Lanterns, while the Pilgrims temper praise with a warning about artifacts as guides; yet no serpent is harmed, no living head is cut, and the city gains a path that can be walked again without taking more than it gives.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M6\"], \"next\": [\"M8\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Ability\", \"description\": \"Shell-Scribe 'Heart-Opening Verse' — a chant that harmonizes with deep pulses; used later as a key to resonate with heart-tuned mechanisms and wards without harming living coral.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Formula\", \"description\": \"Coral glaze formula fragment for Bonewrights — a non-destructive technique to lace bone with coral sheen, inviting living overgrowth to strengthen structures without any cutting of living heads.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Alchemical Phrase\", \"description\": \"Marrow-cooling counterphrase for Rime-Lanterns — a spoken cadence that reduces volatility in crucibles, easing boil and preventing flare without stealing warmth or inviting plague.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"+Favor with Irio Mossvane and balanced goodwill with Bonewrights, Rime-Lanterns, and Pilgrims — standing that eases permits, prices, and escorts on future tides.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
