"{\n  \"missions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"M5\",\n      \"title\": \"Questions on a Mirror\",\n      \"quest_giver\": {\"name\": \"Pera Ilem\", \"affiliation\": \"Rime-Lantern Guild\"},\n      \"description\": \"Mistress Pera Ilem of the Rime-Lantern Guild names fear by a craft-word and makes it kneel: calibration, the narrow edge between safe winter-light and cold-fire that chews through rope and bone. The Tideglass Flats, mirror-bright and pitiless, hold the halite fine enough to quiet crucibles and tune marrow into obedience, and the mirror-tide at dusk is said to answer a single true question if you dare to bind yourself to its answer until the next neap tide. Pera sends her apprentice Lira Thole, a careful hand with ink-stains up to the wrist and a steady way of counting breaths, to walk beside Mara Kestrel across sun-brittled salt that sings beneath each step. Mirage-storms pace the horizon on spindle legs, counterfeit passes crackle in the heat like teeth grinding, and Brinelaw’s writs curl at their edges as if remembering old spray. Somewhere among the pans a quiet ring sells day-rights like cheap blessings, their forged seal bold as gulls and just as hungry, undermining Brinelaw’s authority and stoking guild tempers from Bonewright to Lantern. Bring back halite and a truth, Pera says, and take the stamp without blood to keep the city’s song from souring at the jaw.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Lira Thole to the Tideglass Flats and collect three measures of fine halite without injury.\",\n        \"At dusk, stand upon your reflection and ask one true question of the mirror-tide; record the ripple’s answer.\",\n        \"Identify and disrupt the counterfeit pass ring without causing bloodshed; seize the sealing stamp used on the fakes.\",\n        \"Return safely to the Marrow Vaults with halite and the stamp for Pera Ilem’s audit.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Pera Ilem\", \"lines\": \"Marrow is treacherous because we coax it to be what it was not meant to be, and the city survives because we persuade it gently rather than beat it into shape. Precision is our mercy, and a mercy that slips by a grain becomes a catastrophe that licks along a street and leaves eyes shining the wrong blue. Bring me clean halite from the Flats, sifted so fine it whispers when you breathe on it, and I will shave a fraction off the city’s fear one crucible at a time. At dusk the mirror-tide invites a bargain, and a bargain is a chain that does not care whether you call yourself free while it holds you fast. Choose your question like you choose a friend who has seen you ruined and still takes your hand, for the truth it can bear tells you how much weight it will not drop.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Lira Thole\", \"lines\": \"They say the mirror-tide shows you a worse version of yourself while it answers, a kind of shadow-sister who knows all your stumblings and smirks like a cracked lens when you try to look brave. If that is true, then perhaps the mirror also needs our questions to be brave, because a coward’s question cannot cross a surface so thin without tearing it. I am frightened of the counterfeiters with their quick hands and quicker tempers, but more frightened of boiling a crucible wrong and dousing a street in cold-fire that climbs ribs like ivy. Mistress Pera taught me to count heartbeats between breaths when the brine-smoke thickens, and I will do the same on the Flats when the glare makes the ground look like sky. If you walk a little ahead and listen for the song of thin salt, I will keep the measures straight and my hands steady, and between us we will come home with both halite and a clean conscience.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ketta Brineshaw\", \"lines\": \"If you find the stamp, do not break it, do not throw it in a pit, and do not chase glory by parading it at the Market; bring it in brine and keep its hunger quiet. The Oathwell can taste the ink and tell us what hands drank from the same seal, and with that we can pull threads that lead to quiet doors rather than crashing through stalls while children clutch the table legs. We will cut a silent swathe through the counterfeit ledgers, clip them like dead rope, and no child will go hungry for the sake of a spectacle that makes a magistrate feel tall. Brinelaw prefers a tide that turns a ship rather than a storm that turns a coffin, and I trust your feet to choose the first path even when the second is noisy and tempting. Remember that the law is a net best thrown without knots of pride, and that the city watches how you bind your catches as closely as it watches whom you catch.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Kestrel\", \"lines\": \"Then we will take the salt and the truth, both without spilling blood, and we will leave only footprints that the next tide can wash into clean lines. Lira, you keep the halite white with your careful hands and counting, and I will keep the air clear of knives and words that cut deeper than steel. As for the mirror, I will ask it what I must, and I will not flinch if it shows me a face I have earned on nights I would rather forget. I have carried chains before and learned that some pinch because they are meant to warn, not to break, and I can carry one a few tides longer if it steers light away from the wrong streets. My bowstring hums on nights when Orum dreams, and if the Flats sing back, I will listen and write their song true enough that even a Brinelaw scribe can hear it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Osric Greyfen\", \"lines\": \"Your route crosses a jurisdiction that melts and reforms with the sun, because Brinelaw on the Flats is as much about custom as it is about carved stone. I will not give you a writ to wave like a banner; I will give you the habit of speaking softly and the patience to let a counterfeit seller hear his own fear before you name it. Take two seals of witness wax and a reed of Oathwell brine in case the stamp sings when it should be silent, and remember that an honest question asked at dusk can be stronger than a gaoler’s key. If someone tests you with a forged pass, do not shame them in front of those they feed, but do not let their hunger become a hole that swallows the city either. Bring the stamp, bind no blood, and return with the kind of truth that does not need shackles to stand upright.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Parley Under a White Sun\", \"text\": \"You approach the counterfeit ring openly at their shade-cloth stall, palms visible and rime-lantern hooded, and you begin with prices and weather instead of threats. You let them see Lira’s careful measures and speak about how a bad halite batch makes a crucible spit shards like teeth, nudging them toward the harm their passes can cause without calling them murderers. When the talk ripens, you taste your Oathwell phial and offer a hush-bond that protects their families from public shame if they surrender the seal quietly. You promise to carry their testimony to Brinelaw so that quotas account for the hunger that drove them here, and you anchor that promise with a reed of witness wax stamped with Osric’s plain mark. As the sun climbs, the mirage wind thrums the shade and their bravado thins, leaving room for a choice shaped by dignity rather than cornered panic.\", \"outcome\": \"They hand over the sealing stamp wrapped in salted cloth, and with it a ledger of names spoken low and written clean, because you made the path of surrender feel like a bridge rather than a plank. No blood is drawn, no stall overturned, and the crowd only remembers that a lamplighter’s apprentice bought tea for strangers and a smuggler’s shoulders settled. Lira observes, records the exchange, and learns how mercy calibrates fear as surely as halite steadies a flame. Ketta Brineshaw later uses the ledger to unravel the ring without raids, and Brinelaw issues a quiet adjustment of stall-fees to starve the market for fakes. Pera Ilem notes that the city’s fear scabs a little thicker when precision is paired with kindness, and your favor rises among Lanterns and wary market folk alike.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Silent Hands, Unseen Shadows\", \"text\": \"You choose the night-shade of a noon mirage, when edges blur and footsteps dissolve, to slip through the Flats as a wrecker might and take the stamp with craft. You signal Lira to keep distant and to count while you let the wind hide your approach, moving like a gull’s shadow over salt. A knot of counterfeiters dozes under a sail-cloth lean-to, their seal stowed in a brine crate that sweats cool in the heat, and you plan a theft that bruises no pride. A grapnel’s soft set, a knife on a single stitch, and a bone-broadhead rattled against a far-off pan to turn heads are your tools, because you will not draw blood for a thing that can be undone by patience. When you withdraw, you leave a reed of Brinelaw witness wax in the empty crate, a thin warning that the law is awake but not cruel, and you disappear before a shout finds your name.\", \"outcome\": \"You seize the sealing stamp intact, along with a folio of counterfeit pass blanks that curl at their corners like guilty smiles, and you vanish without stirring a riot. The ring wakes to the witness reed and the absence of their heart, and fear does the work of scattering them so the Flats quiet without a single broken tooth. Later, Ketta’s bailiffs find only footprints and a shed bravado, and Osric’s scribes note that sometimes absence is the cleanest form of justice. Lira praises your restraint but asks to learn the knot you cut, and you teach her, turning a thief’s trick into a craftsman’s lesson about leverage and care. Pera accepts the stamp with a raised brow at the method but cannot argue with a result that leaves no blood on Brinelaw’s tide-clock.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bind the Question to the City\", \"text\": \"At dusk you stand on your reflection, the air cooling enough that the Flats stop their shimmer and your shadow-self looks back with a tired, honest mouth. You choose a question that belongs to more than your pulse, and you ask the mirror-tide what rhythm will keep Dorsalhaven’s chains singing without snapping when Orum dreams again. Your voice is steady, and the water’s skin ripples once, twice, like a slow heartbeat under ice, and then the answer walks across the surface in rings that bend toward the harbor. You count, you trace, you write the distances in the language of rope and rib, and you fix the path in your head with a bowstring hum so you can teach it to others. The binding settles on your shoulders like a wet cloak, not heavy but undeniable, a promise that steers your steps until the next neap writes a new margin on the city’s story.\", \"outcome\": \"The mirror-tide gives you a route-song for the Whispering Rib Shoals, a sequence of bearings and pauses that will let convoys thread safe water when the tide sings strange. Until the next neap you cannot ignore a ship in peril near those bearings without a physical flinch that pulls your feet toward the docks, a gentle compulsion that feels like duty made tidal. Brinelaw hears your transcription and files it under public good with your name etched small, and Chainmasters quietly bless the pattern with chalk on winch-housings. The Pilgrims listen and do not protest, because the song tastes of care rather than harvest, and even Dreamwarden ears can tell the difference. Pera calls it the finest kind of calibration, a truth widened until it fits more than one crucible, and Lira’s admiration shifts into a friendship that looks you in the eye.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Ask for Yourself and Risk the Chain\", \"text\": \"At dusk you stand upon your reflection and decide that a chain honestly named is lighter than a debt you pretend is air, and you ask the mirror-tide for a path to an independent outrider charter. Your voice catches once and steadies, and the surface shivers as if laughing at every promise you have tried to keep to everyone at once. The answer writes itself in lines of hush between ripples, pointing you toward allies who will sign if you dare to refuse easier coin first and toward a danger you must weather without calling in old favors. You taste brine on your tongue that is not from your phial, and you know the binding will make you choose the long road over the short when the choice comes, even if it costs you a warm roof for a tide or two. Lira watches and learns that some questions ask you back, and that is where the weight comes from.\", \"outcome\": \"The mirror-tide binds you to refuse any new debt-bond offered by the Anchor-Compact until the next neap, which means Selka Vire’s clerks leave irritated and impressed in equal measure when you smile and hand back their parchment. In exchange, your path brightens toward Brinelaw recognition, because Osric Greyfen finds you inconveniently honest and that is the kind of person law quietly relies on when storms come. The Ribshadow Brotherhood tests your spine and finds it forked like a rib: firm but curved toward mercy, and Neth Cowl nods once, filing the knowledge away for a night when he will ask you to choose. Pera frowns at losing easy leverage but approves the principle, and Lira writes in her journal that truth can be as sharp as a moon-iron knife and as useful when a knot must be split. Until the next neap, chances to cut your own chain will appear like gulls on good wind, and if you seize them, Brinelaw will have the precedent it needs to ink your independent charter when the tide turns.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M4\"], \"next\": [\"M6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Upgrade\", \"description\": \"Rime-lantern damper upgrade that reduces glare and lessens the attraction of lantern-fish, allowing quieter work on dark water and safer signaling on the Flats.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Key Item\", \"description\": \"Seized counterfeit sealing stamp, delivered to Brinelaw for quiet unraveling of the ring or held in secret if you choose a riskier leverage later.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"+Favor with the Rime-Lantern Guild through Pera Ilem and the warm friendship of Lira Thole, who will speak for your judgment in guild halls and markets alike.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Boons\", \"description\": \"A binding answer from the mirror-tide to one true question, shaping your roleplay and nudging your choices until the next neap tide loosens the chain.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
