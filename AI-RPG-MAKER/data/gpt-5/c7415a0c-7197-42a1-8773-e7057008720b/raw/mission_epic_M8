Moon’s Hook Atoll glows like sifted moonlight poured into a bowl, and in that glittering lagoon men and women trim luck from water with blades that remember storms. Tribute has slipped late, pride sits heavy on ledgers, and the Chainmasters grind their teeth as anchors grind their beds, while the Ribshadow Brotherhood listens for slack water where a convoy might drift into shadow. Matron Selka Vire calls Mara Kestrel by name beneath banners stiff with salt, and tasks her to be both escort and tongue, a ward against steel and a bridge between oaths, to carry Dorsalhaven’s breath across waters thick with dust that steals your sense of tide. Talon Orase, envoy of the Hookcutters with eyes like wet basalt, waits among knives and lantern-fish to hear what the Compact offers and to test if respect weighs as much as coin. Neth Cowl’s skiffs prowl the edges with their lamps hooded and their offers quiet, reminding Mara that currents multiply where chains lie heavy. The lagoon will ask something of her lungs, of her balance, of the honest shape of her words, and she must return with a treaty that does not sell the city’s knees nor tempt its ribs to crack, signed marks that speak above surf and rumor. Between the hum of the Tidemill Array and the whisper of the Shoals, she must keep convoy decks clean of cutting light, keep Selka’s pride from drawing blood, and keep Neth Cowl’s side-currents from drowning the talk before it breathes.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Sail with the convoy to Moon’s Hook Atoll and establish parley with Talon Orase.\",\n        \"Negotiate tribute terms that balance Compact coin, safe passage, and Hookcutter honor.\",\n        \"Prevent a Ribshadow side-deal from scuttling talks without burning bridges; confront Neth Cowl discreetly if necessary.\",\n        \"Return with signed tide-marks and acquired moon-iron arrowheads for emergency line-cutting.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Selka Vire\", \"lines\": \"We pay tribute because it costs less than funerals, and because pride does not float flotsam back to the pier, but know that I will not have our ledgers written at knifepoint. Bring me a signature that does not stink of extortion, and bring it in time for the tide to turn our convoys home with their bellies full. If the Hookcutters demand blood or an oath that bends the city’s knees, you walk away, and I will send decks high enough to spit on their knives and masts tall enough to see them coming. You will mind Brinelaw and do no secret signing that stains the Oathwell by way of some back alley, but you will also remember that a soft word placed well can carry farther than a shouted threat across water. I chose you because you have walked both spans, bone-bright and shadow-salt, and because your ear knows the difference between honest surf and the hiss of a blade sliding free.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Irio Mossvane\", \"lines\": \"Mind the dust, Mara, because moon-iron rides the breath as quiet as fog, and there are navigators who never found their tide again after one night laughing too close to a glittering shore. Keep your hooded lantern trimmed and your compass tucked under cloth when the glow starts to look like home, because that is when it is least true. The Hookcutters respect a straight course more than a loud horn, so let your words keep bearing even when theirs tack and jibe. If they test you with silence, do not rush to fill it, because a sky-barge only falls when the moss panics and puffs too fast. And if Neth’s skiffs ghost past with their lamps winking like cold stars, remember that a favor owed is a tether you cannot always see, and a tether can tangle you when the wind swings.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Talon Orase\", \"lines\": \"Moon-iron cuts bad luck and good rope alike, and we have learned to keep our wrists steady when it sings for blood, but we do not forget the names of those who make us draw it. We know the difference between a tribute paid with respect and a bag of coin hurled like scraps to gulls, and the Compact often pretends not to, all ledgers and none of the taste of salt. What we want is fewer clerks who talk of the sea as if it sits still, and more eyes that have stung in spray and seen a reef rise like a shoulder under a thin green veil. Pay on time, speak plain, and do not send your Brinelaw to tell us what the tide is when we have lived by its pull since before your chains found the seabed. Bring a promise that binds you as surely as it binds us, and you will find our knives eager for fish and rope to mend, not for bellies or flags to bleed.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Neth Cowl\", \"lines\": \"A side current can save a ship when the main flow drags it onto teeth, and a shadow lane can make a treaty sing sweeter because no one must admit the sour notes. I can buy you quiet routes for half what Selka pays in pride if you let the Hookcutters keep their knives pointed at her banners instead of our skiffs, and I can make sure certain cargoes never look tempting enough to ask after. Or you can force a neat treaty and count how many strangled coin-purses float home when hot heads forget to read the marks by moonlight, because numbers on a page do not glow in fog. I do not love the Compact, but I love a city that breathes, and dead convoys choke even my lanes. You know my ledger and I know your bowstring’s song, so let us hum the same note for one night and we both walk away with our eyes and our options.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Osric Greyfen\", \"lines\": \"Brinelaw is not a cudgel you wave in a storm and then hang on a peg when the sun returns, and I would have you remember that when you speak across another shore. If you swear in brine on our city’s behalf, the sting will find my tongue as well as yours, and I do not care for that taste when it is offered lightly. You may parley and you may promise the terms we have discussed, but you may not bind chain or charter beyond a season without my mark at the Oathwell, and you know why, because the Night of Unmoored Chains taught us what happens when haste writes law. Keep an eye for forged passes, because moon-iron makes fools of good men and the Brotherhood has not forgotten the sting of my last sting. Return with tide-marks that keep us honest and them honest enough, and I will see that the Keep’s doors open to you before the crowds press for answers they deserve to hear.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mara Kestrel\", \"lines\": \"Pride is a poor anchor, and so is fear, and I have seen both drag a hull the wrong way when a clean wind begged us forward. Talon, take coin that arrives when promised and a seat at the table when routes are drawn, and in return keep your knives off marked convoys and the families who carry their bread, because those marks will be lines I draw with a hand that has learned its steadiness at the edge of storms. Neth, you know my ledger and the shape of the knot you pulled me from once, and I will not forget, but I will not trade the city’s breath for an easy night either, so if I ask your boats to drift somewhere else, do it because the music says so and not because I lied. Selka, your steel keeps order and your coin keeps lanterns lit, but if we gag the tide with chains of pride we will hear nothing when it warns, and I will not be the one to teach the sea to whisper past us. I will speak plain, I will keep the lantern hooded when dust blows, and I will bring back marks that hold even when the ribs sing strange.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Salt-straight Tribute and Shared Charts\", \"text\": \"Mara steps onto the basalt quay with her hooded lantern low and her compass wrapped, and she opens her palm with coin counted to the last salt-stained weight before any song of grievance begins. She speaks first of timing and then of honor, offering not only tribute but a place at the route-table where Hookcutter voices can track convoy bearings and festival moratoriums, and she keeps her sentences simple until the sun burns thin on the lagoon. She places a Tideglass chart between them and traces with a calloused finger the passages she proposes to mark with paint and prayer, promising to mark those ships as under shared watch rather than Compact alone. She asks no oaths that bend the knee, only those that bind hands to their tools and eyes to their lookout posts, and she swallows a taste of brine without demanding Talon do the same so the sting sits on her tongue alone. She ends by speaking of families on both sides of the water and of the tired ache on nights when knives sing because someone measured respect poorly, and she asks to measure again with care and steady breath.\", \"outcome\": \"Talon Orase listens with knife sheathed and eyes half-hooded, and in the lengthened quiet after Mara finishes he reaches to trace the same routes with his knuckle, neither yielding nor cutting until he finds a mark that feels true, and then he nods like a man who has chosen a tide to ride. The Hookcutters agree to a fixed tribute schedule swearing by their own salt to send a witness to the table when routes are drawn, and in exchange the Compact marks its convoys with a shared sign that calls knives off unless blood is already in the water. Selka Vire is pleased not with joy but with the relief of a ledger that balances without bruising, and her favor warms enough to dry old salt on Mara’s coat while still demanding results next turn of the moon. Neth Cowl drifts back into fog with a tight smile, annoyed that clean lanes leave fewer shadows, but he tips a cap regardless because fewer funerals make for more customers, and because Mara left him a quiet path that does not bite the treaty. Mara returns with signed tide-marks inked in moon-iron glow and Compact blue, and Talon presses into her hand two moon-iron broadheads wrapped in kelp-silk, warning that they are for lines and bad luck only, and together these tokens promise safer convoy passage for a season and a respect that can deepen if not betrayed.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Chain-high Stance and Brinelaw Warning\", \"text\": \"Mara plants her boots at the waterline where the moon-dust hisses and refuses to step further into the glow, and she lets her voice carry like a bell struck under the Dorsal Span. She recalls the Night of Unmoored Chains and the Brinelaw’s right of levy, and she describes in plain, hard words what the Chainmaster’s decks will look like if the Hookcutters mistake silence for weakness again. She holds up the rolled writ bearing Osric Greyfen’s seal without breaking it, letting its weight speak of tribunals and tariffs sharpened like harpoons, and she reminds them that the Compact survived storms deeper and knives sharper and will do so again with or without a clean treaty. She does not spit or sneer but neither does she soften, and she lays a tribute purse on the basalt without stepping back, counting the coins aloud like a toll at a bridge that has already been built. She ends with a choice that is not quite a threat and not quite a plea, pointing to the horizon where the convoys wait under rime-lantern glow, and she says the tide is turning either way and it would be wise not to be beneath it when it breaks.\", \"outcome\": \"Talon Orase smiles without humor and measures Mara’s stance as a boatman might measure a crosswind, and after a tense moment he snatches the purse and ties it to his belt because his people must eat and because pride cannot patch nets. The agreement that follows is narrow and cold, a season’s worth of passage given under watchful knives and eyes that count how many Compact banners brush the lagoon air, and every clause sparkles like frost with unspoken grudges. Selka’s hawks in the Anchor-King’s Hall praise Mara’s steel and call the tribute neat as a ledger ruled with iron, but the old sailors along the jawbone mutter that the sea remembers sharp words as well as kind. Neth Cowl grins wide in the fog because hard treaties drive more captains to ask after side lanes where shadows cost less than bruises, and he files the angle of Mara’s jaw under useful knowledge. The signed tide-marks are returned to Dorsalhaven on time and the moon-iron broadheads lie heavy in Mara’s kit, but the marks carry a thin scent of smoke, and while convoys move safer for a season, the Hookcutters’ respect is wary at best and may snap if provoked.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Shadow Current with the Brotherhood\", \"text\": \"Mara meets Neth Cowl at slack water where the cove is a mouth half-open, and she speaks in a voice that does not carry beyond the rope-slung stones. She proposes a ghost lane for the heaviest cargos on fog-thick nights when the Hookcutters are busy with their own tides, a lane that shifts like kelp in the surge and leaves only clean wakes where inspectors might look. She makes it clear she wants no blood and no storms, only a cushion of time around formal parley so that Talon hears fewer rumors of greedy convoys and sees fewer glints that tempt his crews to cut. She demands that any counterfeit passes be burned and any bribed clerks sleep elsewhere for a season, because Brinelaw eyes have gone hawk-sharp and she will not string a noose from her own words. She offers Neth a ledger of limits because a favor tied too tight to shadows will one day drown her, and she insists that if the treaty fails on its own terms he will not pretend this shadow work was the rope that pulled it under.\", \"outcome\": \"Neth Cowl chuckles like a man who just found a coin he dropped last winter, and he agrees to slip certain loads around the Hook’s teeth on nights when the dust glows brightest and everyone is distracted by its false moon. With fewer fat targets dragging slow under banners, the Hookcutters come to the table less hungry for proof and more ready to weigh the tribute for what it is, and Talon finds his temper less pricked by rumor and smoke. The talks run cleaner, and though Selka would frown to learn how the sea smoothed itself, the result pleases her enough that she asks no questions and writes a commendation line that will matter later. Brinelaw watches for a scent of forgery and finds none, and Osric Greyfen nods a warning that says he knows a shadow passed and that it had better keep its hands out of his well for a while. Mara returns with the signed tide-marks and two moon-iron broadheads coiled in kelp-silk at the bottom of her quiver, and with a quiet understanding with the Ribshadow Brotherhood that breathes like slack water, dangerous if you forget how quickly the tide returns.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Moon-Iron Rite and Oathwell Echo\", \"text\": \"Mara arranges a small rite at the edge of the lagoon where the glow runs thin, laying out a strip of kelp-silk, a phial of Oathwell brine, and a wrapped bundle from the Bonewrights, her hands steady despite the dust. She tells Talon the story of the city’s first chain set by a king who understood that chains should sing and not strangle, and she asks whether the Hookcutters will sing with them for a season so no one must drown their own song in pride. She unwraps the bundle to reveal a pair of compact line-cutters made of clean bone and tempered with Tideglass salt, gifts from the city to sit beside moon-iron so that knives have companions better suited to rope than to flesh. She wets her tongue with a measured drop from the Oathwell phial and lets the sting sit, promising to carry this taste whenever she speaks of this treaty in halls and on decks, and she scatters the rest into the shallows so the lagoon can refuse falsehood from either shore. She closes by asking Talon to bless the arrowheads he will give, not as weapons but as tools to cut misfortune, and to mark the tide-marks with a sign of his choosing so that both peoples recognize the same promise by sight and sound.\", \"outcome\": \"Talon Orase watches the rite with the careful solemnity of a man who knows superstition can be another current worth riding, and when Mara tastes the brine without asking him to do the same he nods as if a weight shifted from one shoulder to the other. He produces two moon-iron broadheads and, before handing them over, touches them to the lagoon surface and murmurs an old Hookcutter phrase that sounds like pebbles rolling in a wave, making tools of them in the manner of his people. The tribute is set not only in coin but in shared signs, with a small knot-work mark placed alongside the Compact seal on the tide-marks, and the Hookcutters pledge to respect that knot for a season whether they like the faces under the banners or not. Selka is pragmatic enough to accept the rite after the fact, praising results while instructing Mara to keep future symbolism tasteful and properly witnessed, and she quietly admits that honor can carry where tariffs cannot. The convoy returns riding a calm earned by respect and watched by knives that stay sheathed, with signed tide-marks that gleam subtly under moonlight and the blessed arrowheads tucked away for the moment when a single clean cut might save a ship, and for a while the lagoon’s glow feels less like a trap and more like a lookout’s lamp shining the way home.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M7\"], \"next\": [\"M9\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Two moon-iron broadheads for emergencies, honed to sever fouled lines or bad luck when a single clean cut saves lives.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Document\", \"description\": \"Signed tide-marks guaranteeing safer convoy passage for a full season, stamped with Compact seal and Hookcutter sign.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Increased favor with the Anchor-Compact under Selka Vire and earned respect with the Hookcutters under Talon Orase for fair, timely tribute and plain dealing.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Faction Relationship\", \"description\": \"A quiet understanding with the Ribshadow Brotherhood if shadow currents were handled discreetly, opening hushed lanes without burning bridges.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
