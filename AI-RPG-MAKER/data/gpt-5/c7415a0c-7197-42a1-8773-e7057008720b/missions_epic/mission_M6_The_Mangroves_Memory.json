    "description": "The Sighing Mangrove pulls one long, patient note from hollow roots and wind-split reeds, a breath that never ends and threads itself through skull and thought. Mara Kestrel rides a flatboat whose bow is painted with a warding eye, guiding Chainmaster riggers under Brinelaw quotas while oar-blades count the slow heartbeats of the river. Pilgrim vigil-keepers drift alongside in stilted skiffs, their reed-knots heavy with names and their eyes sharper than ospreys; they watch every notch on a sapling as if it were a tally mark on a soul. Glass eels splice the current into knives of quicksilver, midges drill at the edges of every thought, and sinkholes open like mouths under the hummocked water where old logs lie like sleeping crocodiles. Between rope and rite, between law and lingering grief for what the forest remembers, Mara must keep axes honest, charts true, and tempers just shy of blade. She has been told the marsh-goddess takes payment in memories that weigh a spirit down, and that she favors songs; Mara carries a lullaby at the edge of her tongue that smells of warm lanolin and marrow-light, and she wonders what kind of silence would follow if it went away. Somewhere in the reed-knotted shrines, there is a hint that points toward the Pilgrims’ whispered Heart-Scale, a secret like sunrise wrapped in kelp-silk veils.",

I am not sending you upriver to break a faith or to win a hymn, I am sending you to bring back enough resin to keep the Array’s jaws greased so they do not chew another crew. The Pilgrims will call our saws blasphemy and our quotas greed, but Brinelaw carved those numbers into bark with both their hands on the Oathstones and I will hold to them like a chain in a gale. If the marsh-goddess wants a memory, give her one that will not take your legs from under you when the tide turns, because I need those legs planted on the skiff when the eels light up. I have my own bundle of memories I would gladly throw to the reeds, but they are not mine to trade for your passage, and I will not drown you in debts you did not choose. Do this clean, do this careful, and give the Pilgrims a song if they will take it in lieu of an argument, because a soft word keeps blades sleeping in their sheaths. Bring me resin and bring me a clear report, and make sure that the only thing we leave behind is footing that others can trust."

Walk softer than your oath permits, Mara Kestrel, because the brine on a tongue does not absolve the thunder of a careless boot. If you must take resin, ask first by pouring a circle of brine and singing the names of those who cut before you, and the reeds will tell you if the grove is ready to bleed. The goddess is vain as any of us who love a mirror of water, but her vanity is tenderness turned inside out, and what she wants is to be kept in the mouths of the living. Bring her a memory you no longer need and not a pillar of who you are, and she will broaden your path and hush the eels until you have passed. Mark your channels with honesty rather than ambition, because many feet will follow your pencil line and I would not have you answer for a child who steps where a root gives way. If you carry word of the Heart-Scale, carry it as you would a sleeping ember, because it can warm a city or burn a house in the same breath."

            "lines": "Little archer who smells of salt glass and moon steel, I have watched you walk the bone of a dead giant and listen for a beat that is not yours, and I know the tremor of a heart that leans toward songs. Give me the taste of a tune you have kept like stale bread in your cheek and I will turn the wind so it threads your banners and not your throats, because I am fond of those who pay in music rather than blood. Keep your axes from my oldest knees, do not notch the trees that bow toward the shrines with reed-knots and driftwood eyes, and I will guide your poles over mud that looks like sky and feels like teeth. I will fold the current over the glass eels so they dream under you, and I will whisper a path that curves around holes you cannot see, and you will draw that path so even fools read it as prayer. In the hollows of my grove, someone hid a scale that sings when a true hymn finds it, and I will tell you the color of the veil that hides it if your gift pleases me. Leave me gossip of the city’s chains, leave me the memory of how marrow light smells when it is first lit, and take from me a small silence where a lullaby once lived, and do not begrudge the quiet when it comes."

I have a lullaby that my mother hummed when the lanterns were warm and the crucibles did not spit, and I have kept it tucked in the back of my teeth these ten years, and perhaps it has grown stale with grief until it can do no one any good. I will give you the shape of it without the words, I will give you the rise and fall and the hiss of breath on the rests, and I will keep the part that is only her name, because I cannot cut that root and still be myself on the far bank. I will map your channels on salt glass and bone-ink so clear that even a drunk in a storm will see how the river wants to be walked, and I will hand that map to Brinelaw so others can live on the safe line. I will keep the axes back from the hallowed knees, I will pour brine and sing as I take, and I will carry your hint of the hidden scale like a wrapped coal that warms without burning. If the Pilgrims come with hard eyes and soft knives, I will answer them with song and with ledger, and if they must have a promise I will taste salt again and let the Oathwell sting my tongue rather than see another Night of Unmoored Chains in a forest of roots."

            "text": "You step to the driftwood altar where reed-knots whisper and midges make a halo around the lantern, and you let the lullaby lift from your mouth like steam on a winter morning. The Loggers hold their breath and the Pilgrims lower their eyes, for no one is so rude as to stare at a gift given to a god who lives in the echo between breaths. You sing without words, shaping the tune with the same care you use to fletch an arrow, letting the memory of warmth and marrow light carry the melody until it thins and is gone. You feel the lack as a gentling rather than a loss, as if a knot that had pulled your shoulder crooked eased at last, and the silence that follows is tender, not cruel. In that quiet, the roots exhale, the eels turn to sleep, and a low whisper tells you of a veil the color of drowned kelp where a soft glow hides beneath prayers, while the water’s skin goes slick as glass where the safe channel runs.",
            "outcome": "The goddess accepts the song and widens the breath that moves through the mangrove, and the current favors your poles for as many bends as it takes to reach the quota groves. The logging is done with ceremonies observed and tempers unlit, and the Pilgrims bow their heads as resin jars are carried past reed-knots sprinkled with brine. You trace a channel that skirts two sinkholes you would never have seen without the hush that came from the offering, and you etch it into salt glass for Brinelaw posting. Garrik pays hazard coin with a rare smile and stamps your route with the Union mark, while Siala murmurs that the goddess has not been so generous in a season. In your mind there is a gentle absence where the lullaby once sat, and in its place the goddess’s hint lingers like a green ribbon of thought, pointing toward veils within veils where a Heart-Scale waits under patient prayers."

            "text": "You bow to the hollow root and to the reeds, and you say that your memories are bound to oaths already, and that you will not unmoor one bond to tie another without the Oathwell’s taste. You pour a slow circle of brine, you list the names of cutters who taught you their careful hands, and you promise to mark every step and to spare any tree that leans toward a shrine like a listener to a story. You order saws sheathed whenever a Pilgrim hums a warning note, and you parcel the work into small, quiet cuts that bleed resin without waking the grove’s anger. The midges ease as if respecting the patience of your restraint, and the eels drift aside as if the solemnity of your rites sated a hunger they did not know they had. The marsh is stubborn, and progress is slow, but the wind does not knife, and at dusk a hush falls across the water that is not quite blessing and not quite indifference, like someone remembering your face but not your name.",
            "outcome": "The goddess does not take a memory, but she answers your courtesy with a grudging stillness that keeps the worst harms asleep, and the crew returns with enough resin to keep the Array honest without cutting into sacred knees. Your map is born from careful probing and long patience instead of a whispered path, and it still threads the sinkholes because you marked every reed that bent differently when the pole touched danger. Garrik accepts the delay with grumbling but honors the Hazard Mark, and Siala nods once, satisfied that reverence can be practiced without theatrics. That night as you drift under a sky like hammered tin, a murmur passes along the roots like a thought finishing itself, and in it you catch the color of the veil and the place where the prayer cords knot twice, a small concession from a god who respects stubborn kindness. Your reward is unchanged in coin and charter and in the quiet in your chest, and though you kept your lullaby, you somehow know the same hint the generous offering would have won, as if the marsh agreed to remember it for you until you were ready to hear."

            "text": "You climb a stilt of root and speak where both crews can see, laying your bow across your knees like a folded oar, and you ask the Chainmaster foreman to move his saws three bends farther where the bark-scars are older and the shrines are fewer. You promise Garrik’s quota by dusk tomorrow if the routes are shifted, and you swear brine on your phial that you will work into the night with a pole and compass to lay a channel that makes the longer haul easier forever. You ask the Pilgrim vigil-keepers to set their hymns at the edge of the new stand and to bless the resin jars so that each cut feels like a prayer answered rather than a plea ignored. You place your moon-iron knife on a stump in the open, blade wrapped and idle, to show there will be no severing of promises this day, and you ask Siala to witness your ledger so the act becomes memory carved in rite. The reeds lean as if listening, and a breeze runs like a hand over a choir, and both sides step back from their hard lines as if they had been strung too taut.",
            "outcome": "The crews shift as asked, with mutters swallowed by the work, and the resin flows from trees old enough to offer without harm, while shrines stand untouched and garlanded with fresh kelp-silk. The Pilgrims sing low and steady and the eels coil into sleep beneath that sound, and your poles find purchase where they might have slipped if the song were sharp with anger. Your map grows longer but cleaner, and when you hand it to Brinelaw, even a clerk who hates the smell of marsh smiles at the clarity of its bends and marks. Garrik stamps your hazard pay and later admits over a tin of night-watch tea that losing one day to gain ten was coin well spent, while Siala places a reed-knot in your palm that smells faintly of cold light. The marsh-goddess, pleased by restraint that needed no bargain, brushes your ear with a whisper about a kelp-colored veil and the sleeping glow beneath it, and the absence you carry is not a stolen lullaby but the empty space where violence might have gone and did not."

            "text": "At dusk you send a gull-sign the Brotherhood taught you, and a skiff with tar-black ribs ghosts out from a stand of mangrove like a thought you would rather not own. Their pilot, face shaded by a woven hat, shows you a lane that smugglers use when Brinelaw counts noses upriver, and it overlaps your quotas with uncanny efficiency while skirting shrines by inches. You keep the crews honest in the open and let the shadowed skiff scout ahead, counting eddies and testing roots where a pole’s whisper can be heard but not seen. It is a compromise that tastes of old debts and salt on the tongue, and you carry it carefully, making sure that every advantage taken serves safety rather than theft. The night hums with the marsh’s long note, and you think of Oathwell sting and the city’s chains, and you promise yourself to pay for this shortcut by carving a brighter path for those who will not have such dark friends to guide them.",
            "outcome": "The Ribshadow lane holds true and the crews move like a school of fish through narrow turns that would have stranded them without the smuggler’s intuition, and the resin arrives without a single shrine cut or a single pole lost. You chart the route in a form fit for Brinelaw, rinsed of any hint of contraband, and it remains a safe channel because safety was always its spine. Garrik pays and pretends not to notice how quickly you solved what had stymied other outriders, and Siala gifts you a look that says she knows about debts but is content that the shrines stand whole. The marsh-goddess, amused by human cunning that still kneels to reverence, hums through the roots and tells you of a veil the color of drowned kelp and of a glow that will answer to a true whale-hymn, sealing your reward in hint and hush. You leave with coin, with a map that will keep children dry-shod, with favor from Union hands and eased eyes from Pilgrim watchers, and with a small, persistent quiet where a song used to weigh you down, whether you traded it openly or let the marsh carry it for you until the work was done."
