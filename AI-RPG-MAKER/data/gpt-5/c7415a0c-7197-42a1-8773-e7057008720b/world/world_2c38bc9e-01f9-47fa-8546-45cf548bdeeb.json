    "city": "Dorsalhaven, the City on the Leviathan, is built along the bleached spine and ribcage of Orum, the sea-colossus that beached and died two centuries ago during the Year of the Black Tide. Its avenues follow the vertebrae, its bridges are the ribs made into arches, and its harbor yawns from the jawbone where chain-gates bite the surge. Bone-lace balconies, salt-brick terraces, tarred rope railings, and lanterns that burn with cold marrow-light define a skyline that sings in the wind: hundreds of bone chimes strung from every eave. The city thrums to the pull of the tide through iron chains that link quay to seabed; the Tidemill Array gnashes and drinks the ocean’s force, powering cranes, mills, and the rime-lantern manufactories at night. The Dorsal Span, a broad thoroughfare atop the spine, hosts the Founding Tide procession each equinox, when citizens carry salt and kelp-silk banners past the Rib Cathedral of Orum to the Anchor-King’s Hall. Brinelaw—the city’s code carved into twelve tide-stained stones—binds oaths made over the Oathwell in the Brinelaw Keep; a contract sworn in brine is said to sting the tongue if betraying hands later sign another. Power lies not with a crowned monarch but with the Anchor-Compact, a consortium of merchant houses who convene in the old Anchor-King’s Hall beneath banners stiff with salt. Below them wheel the great guilds: Chainmasters who keep the chains singing and the harbor fed; Bonewrights who ration the sacred bone; Rime-Lantern alchemists who refine marrow into steady winter-light; and the Brinelaw Keepers who measure justice by the tide-clock. The Pilgrims of Orum’s Dream tend the bone reliquaries and claim the Leviathan is not dead but sleeping; their dreamfasts and whale-song vigils challenge the city’s hunger to harvest what remains. Dorsalhaven’s prosperity rests on risky dependencies: timber ferried from the Sighing Mangrove to scaffold ribs and repair piers; salts collected from the mirror-bright Tideglass Flats to fix dyes and temper alchemy; and convoys to Moon’s Hook Atoll, where coin keeps pirates at bay as often as steel does. Trade climbs from sea to sky at the Sargassum Aerarium, where moss-bladders hold sky-barges steady in brine-scented thermals. The city remembers the Night of Unmoored Chains, when a storm and sabotage snapped the harbor taut and iron scythed the docks; since then, Brinelaw demands double-checked rivets and shared liability for any chain entrusted to the public good. Whispers persist of the Marrow Plague—skin turned pallid, eyes phosphor-blue—whenever Rime-Lanterns vent their crucibles. As waves polish the jaw and gulls chalk the spine, a legend taps like a quiet heartbeat beneath the city: when Orum’s heart beats again, the chains will break, and every oath made in brine will be called home.",
