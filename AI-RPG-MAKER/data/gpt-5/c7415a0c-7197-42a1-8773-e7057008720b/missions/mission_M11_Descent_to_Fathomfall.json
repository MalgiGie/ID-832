    "description": "The Fathomfall Trench lies like a blue bruise offshore, its rim visible when the water turns cobalt and the city stops to stare. The resonance note from the Vault, the shard from the Array, and the Heart-Opening Verse all point here. Irio assembles a slim crew: a Chainmaster diver with lungs like bellows, a Pilgrim singer with a voice that can hold a note against the sea, and Mara to guide by feel and chart what instruments cannot. Lantern-fish mimic rime-lantern glow and pull at the eyes like sleep. Squeeze currents grab at bones and try to make them forget their names. Somewhere below, something slow as winter answers to a hymn.",
    "objectives": [
        "Assemble a small crew: Irio Mossvane (navigator), a Chainmaster diver (Vesk Marran), and a Pilgrim singer (designated by Siala).",
        "Anchor at the Trench rim and descend in stages, planting three song-nodes tuned to the Heart-Opening Verse.",
        "Evade predatory lantern-fish by using damped lanterns and moon-iron to cut emergency lines if snagged.",
        "Listen for and record the deep pulse; retrieve a scale or message if the heart answers without provoking a violent upwelling."
