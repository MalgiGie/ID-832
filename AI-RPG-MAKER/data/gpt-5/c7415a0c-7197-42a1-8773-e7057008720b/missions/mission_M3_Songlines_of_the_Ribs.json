    "description": "Dean Yhosa Kel of the Bonewrights’ Collegium receives Mara atop the Dorsal Span where bone-plates gleam like pale waves. The Bonewrights argue that the city must learn the new rhythm in its ribs if the Array is not to grind itself out of true. Yhosa gives her a lacquered chart scored with delicate grooves to catch the whisper-song and a bone cup etched with bearings. A flotilla of Pilgrims glides below with candles, their whale-song a low thrum under wind and gull. Between the shoaling eddies and the hollow marrow-songs of the submerged ribs, Mara will trace three points of resonance to anchor a safer chart through the Whispering Rib Shoals. In the song is an answer to the shard’s hum, and perhaps to Orum’s heart.",

        "Consult with Pilgrims of Orum’s Dream to compare hymnals and the rib-song you hear.",
        "Deliver the completed chart to Yhosa Kel and log a copy with Brinelaw for public use."

The ribs carry us still, and when they sing, we would be fools not to listen. Take this chart. It will not survive a lie—if you pretend to hear what you do not, the lacquer will crack like ice and waste your work. Bring me three true notes, and I will add buttresses where the song says we can stand."

And hear me: if those Pilgrims try to turn this into a procession instead of a survey, you signal and I will pull you out hard. I respect a hymn as much as any mother’s lullaby, but I will not lose another hand to reverence."
