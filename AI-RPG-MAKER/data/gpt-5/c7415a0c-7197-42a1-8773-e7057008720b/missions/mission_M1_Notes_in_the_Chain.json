    "description": "The tide is running strong through the jaw-harbor, and the Tidemill Array sings a note it should not know. Matron Selka Vire calls Mara Kestrel to the Anchor-King’s Hall under banners stiff with salt, the ledgers like tablet-waves around her. She speaks of contracts that tremble when the chains do, of convoy schedules slurred by a hum no tariff can reckon. Foreman Garrik Shale has sounded alarms at the Array, claiming the machines slip their rhythm on nights the marrow-lamps burn cold; Selka hears sabotage, but the Pilgrims whisper it is Orum’s dreaming. The city remembers the Night of Unmoored Chains, and the Brinelaw stones taste of iron today. Selka wants a watcher who can hear the city’s secret songs and not flinch—someone whose bowstring has hummed this note before. She presses a weighted brass pass into Mara’s palm and orders her to walk the chainwheels and listen for what the ledgers cannot tally.",

I sponsored your probation because you hear what others call superstition, and you translate it to terms even Brinelaw can bite. Walk the Array for me. Bring back more than superstition—bring back a shard, a stain, a proof that tells me if I must pay for compliance or for war."

I’ve lost two men to cold shock in the sluices this month because tools turn slick when that damned note comes. If this is the Compact squeezing overtime by candle, I’ll slow the wheels to a crawl and let the city count the cost. If it’s something deeper, I’ll put my mark beside yours and we’ll force the Hall to listen."
