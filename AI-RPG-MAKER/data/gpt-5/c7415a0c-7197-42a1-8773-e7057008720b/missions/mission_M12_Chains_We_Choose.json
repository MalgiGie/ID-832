    "description": "The Anchor-King’s Hall fills like a lung before a shout. Matron Selka Vire and High Bailiff Osric Greyfen convene the Anchor-Compact, the guilds, and the Pilgrims to hear what Mara carried back from the Trench. Bonewright banners hang heavy; Chainmasters stand with arms like posts; the Rime-Lanterns burn their cold fire with quiet pride; the Pilgrims hold the Scale as if it were an oath made flesh. The question is not whether Orum’s heart stirs, but what Dorsalhaven will do when it does. Bind the city tighter to the seabed with law and iron and hymns? Loosen the chains and trust to compacts made in public instead of in fear? In the hall, an old meteor-iron link hums under the speaker’s dais, and rumors say it makes cautious men more cautious still. Mara’s voice, backed by charts and shards and songs, must set the course. And when the Oathwell’s brine bites her tongue one last time, she will speak the chain she means to carry, and the one she means to cut.",

Brinelaw recognizes independent outriders under public oath at the Oathwell, with shared routes posted and shared risk accepted. The Array rests when the ribs hum warning, marrow cools by a song all can learn, and Pilgrims mark holy nights that even coin respects. And for those who fed their children by shadow, here is a lane: licensed salvage at posted ribs, taxes scaled to storm-loss, and no knives for chains. I drink this brine and I bind myself to carry this chain, and cut the others."
