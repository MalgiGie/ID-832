    "description": "The Founding Tide procession rolls along the Dorsal Span like a second sea—banners of salt and kelp-silk, bone chimes and rime-lanterns swinging their winter light. The Pilgrims will carry veiled relics past the Rib Cathedral, and Siala Nerm means to unveil a Heart-Scale to prove Orum dreams. The Anchor-Compact sees a riot in the making; Brinelaw tastes liability; the Chainmasters smell cut ropes under song. Whispers say a faction will sabotage the procession, either to shame the Pilgrims or to shatter the Compact’s calm. The city holds its breath. When Orum’s ribs hum, it will not be myth or sabotage alone—it will be the city’s answer to its own question.",
    "objectives": [
        "Guard the procession along the Dorsal Span and watch for saboteurs at key choke points and oath-stalls.",
        "Coordinate with Brinelaw bailiffs to reroute crowds if stampede risk increases; use the Resonance Chart to anticipate dangerous rhythms.",
        "Decide whether to support Siala’s unveiling of the Heart-Scale publicly or urge a private audience at the Anchor-King’s Hall.",
        "Prevent a deliberate chain cut beneath the Span from causing a collapse; apprehend the culprits if possible."
