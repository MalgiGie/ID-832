    "description": "The Sighing Mangrove draws a single note from wind and root, a breath that never ends. Chainmaster crews need resin and timber to keep the Array honest, and quotas have Pilgrims snarling over sacred groves. Garrik Shale sends Mara upriver to escort a logging party under Brinelaw quotas, to negotiate with the marsh-goddess if the old shrines balk, and to keep the vigil-keepers from cutting ropes instead of trees. The marsh-goddess trades safe passage for memories you no longer use; rumors say she is fond of songs. Between sinkholes, midges, and glass eels, the journey is as much a test of patience as of blade. Somewhere in the reed-knots is a hint of the Heart-Scale the Pilgrims cherish like a secret sunrise.",

If a goddess wants a memory, give her one that lets you sleep. I’ve got a handful I could spare, but they’re not mine to trade for this crew."
