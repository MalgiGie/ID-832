    "description": "Night gathers under the bluffs, and the Salt Widow’s Lighthouse leans into the wind with its cold, stubborn light. Captain Neth Cowl sends a folded bone-lace message through the Market of Teeth: a cache of old wrecker ledgers and storm marks lies in a seam-cave beneath the tower, and Brinelaw is sniffing down the coast. He wants the cache retrieved or scuttled, and he wants to know why the beacon never dies when thieves swear it dead. The Salt Widow’s legend is as sharp as her lampstone: those who try to snuff the beacon see their own lights refuse to spark forever after. Inside the tower, lamp-smoke tastes of salt-wedding sorrow, and wind moves like a dress around the stairs. The records down there could teach the city where the shoals creep and how saboteurs hid their boats the night the chains went wild—or they could bury families in fines and shackles.",
    "objectives": [
        "Travel by night skiff to the Salt Widow’s Lighthouse and infiltrate the seam-cave at slack water.",
        "Recover the cache of wrecker ledgers and storm records without drawing Brinelaw attention.",
        "Investigate the beacon’s cold flame and note any alchemical or occult mechanism.",
        "Decide whether to deliver the records to Neth Cowl, to Osric Greyfen, or to split the intelligence between them."

Those ledgers aren’t lists of crimes; they’re the names of children who ate because their elders cut a sail off a dead ship. Bring me those books and I’ll keep the names safe. If the Brinelaw wants to fix a danger, they can pay to move the shoals with prayer and coin."
