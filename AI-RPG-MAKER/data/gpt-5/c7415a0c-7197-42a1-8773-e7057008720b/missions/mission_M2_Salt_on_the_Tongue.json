    "description": "Brinelaw does not move without brine upon the tongue. High Bailiff Osric Greyfen summons Mara to the Brinelaw Keep, where the tide-clock rises in its stone throat and the Oathwell waits with winter on its surface. He has heard of the shard from the Array and the hum that touches the city’s sleep; he has also heard that forged passes still flow like cheap wine to the Tideglass Flats. Osric offers a writ of investigation—that sharp needle that lets a citizen prick secrets without drawing a gaol-sentence. Ketta Brineshaw, a tide-scribe with steady hands and salt-pricked eyes, will open the ledgers and the seized evidence, including a salt-glass pass with a thumbprint trapped in its heart. A choice blooms like rime on iron: follow the law inward until it stings, or let shadows do their work until the law must taste its own salt.",

If the Array is touched by sabotage, I must cut out the rot before it spreads. If it is touched by myth, I must make room for faith without letting it capsized the law. Swear to me in salt, Mara Kestrel, that what you bring back will be true enough to survive the Oathwell’s memory."

Whoever made this knew our inks and our hourglasses and the way our bailiffs sweat on their rounds. If we follow the lines in the glass, they lead to the Flats, to the Market, and to someone who understands both ledgers and lulls."

If you ask me a straight question, I’ll give you a straight answer with a bend in it: the forged passes keep fisher families fed when tariffs gnaw to the bone. The Array’s hum is not ours. We prefer chains that sing true, because we dance on them at night."

And Captain Cowl, if I find your prints where the law cannot ignore them, I will put the truth on Osric’s bench and let the tide decide. No one dances if the chain parts."
