    "description": "Irio Mossvane, sky-barge navigator and old friend, leans on a bone rail at the Sky-Quay and watches the air-moss breathe. He has a charter to reach the Coral Library of Nareth with a joint delegation from the Bonewrights and the Rime-Lantern Guild. The coral keeps questions like pearls; pry them wrong and you bleed. Yhosa Kel wants Shell-Scribe technique to lace bone with coral; Pera Ilem wants glyphs that cool marrow without plague; the Pilgrims want the Library left uncut. The reef sings in circles and serpents bow to no flag. The sliver of coral hidden under Mara’s bow-grip hums in sympathy; something below remembers her already.",
    "objectives": [
        "Sail by coastal hops to the Coral Library of Nareth with Irio’s guidance, avoiding trick currents.",
        "Sing the opening verse taught by Pilgrims to unseal a question-knot; retrieve a memory that belongs to no one and everyone.",
        "Evade or pacify a territorial reef-serpent without killing it; preserve the Library’s living coral.",
        "Return fragments of Shell-Scribe technique or hymn to Yhosa Kel and Pera Ilem, and share a Pilgrim-approved copy for the Reliquary."

            "lines": "I’ve seen storms that breathe easier than this dock. The air-moss knows a squall two hours before a gull does, and it’s humming like a kettle. We’ll thread the reefs as if we’re threading a quarrel through your bow—slow, precise, and with no waste. If the Library asks you something, don’t answer with pride. Pride reads as hunger in the water."

If you find a verse that chills without stealing the heat from hands and hearts, bring me even a fragment. I am tired of the word ‘plague’ being used as a cudgel and a prayer in the same breath."
