    "description": "The Marrow Vaults breathe like a sleeping beast beneath salt-glass and iron. Pera Ilem calls Mara down three locks and two witnesses deep to a sealed chamber thrumming with Shell-Scribe glyphs. Workers whisper the word plague as if it has teeth; the crucibles are colder than they should be, and a lamp guttered blue over an apprentice’s hand. The fragment of coral-song Mara brought back might bridge the Vault’s hymn to something broader, and the humming shard from the Array sings near this sealed door. Brinelaw wants safety; Bonewrights want assurance the Vault won’t crack the city’s bones for profit. Somewhere in the cold is a stabilizer formula and an answer that lets lamps burn without blanching skin and eyes.",
    "objectives": [
        "Use the ‘Heart-Opening Verse’ to harmonize the sealed chamber and identify the source of the cold hum.",
        "Assist Lira Thole in calibrating a safe venting of pressure without releasing volatile marrow vapors.",
        "Decide whether to share the full stabilizer formula with Brinelaw, Rime-Lanterns, and Bonewrights equally or gate it through Pera Ilem.",
        "Investigate the humming shard’s resonance with the chamber and record its pitch for the Resonance Chart."

            "lines": "Fear is a solvent; it strips nuance from the air. We will not let panic do here what plague could not. Sing your verse, match the pitch, and we will ease this chamber open like a jaw easing a stubborn knot. If there is a formula inside it will not be stolen; it will be stewarded. I have buried enough apprentices to know the difference."

If you find nothing, I will still publish a calm notice so the Market does not set itself on fire with rumor. I tell you this in brine before the locks, so you can weigh your conscience by the taste."
