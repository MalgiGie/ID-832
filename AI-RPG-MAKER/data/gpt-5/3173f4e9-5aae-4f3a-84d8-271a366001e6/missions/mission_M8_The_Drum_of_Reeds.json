    "description": "South along the floodplain, the Elderbarrow Marsh drinks the sky. Warm vapors rise at dusk, and willow roots clutch broken stones carved in dead tongues. Aerin poles a flatboat with Roa Mestri, whose hands tremble on the oar. The Drum of Reeds swells from peat and fog, and when the red moon lifts, the mound thunders soft like a giant’s heart. Will-o’-wisps blink like watch-lanterns gone astray, and the mud tries to take boots and breath alike. Roa breaks midstream and confesses—she took River Lord coin to ‘delay the breath one bell,’ telling herself it spared panic; she will answer. Before they can turn back, hireblades rise from the reeds with eel-skin purses and a rope knot tied the Rafter way. The fight is slick and close, but the marsh swallows those who do not respect it. In the thrum and the hush after, Aerin cuts heart-reed and threads it with her breath. The tone it holds is old and kind; it might yet quiet a crowd or call a rib back from a shiver.",
