    "description": "Salt squalls rake the terraces eastward when a Conclave runner finds Aerin with Sera Dake’s summons. Kessa Tharn, an inspector with a nose for hairline fractures and forged seals, vanished after flagging a suspect maintenance certification that would have sent weight through a rib in ways the Hollow Oath forbids. The Lantern trail leads down-rope into the Ossuary Gardens, where the air tastes like mushrooms and old rain. Among whispering sporelight and the slow crackle of mycelium remembering footsteps, Aerin finds Kessa broken but breathing, tucked beneath shelf fungus by panicked hands. A rafter’s knot at her wrist and brine grit on her boots speak of a struggle that crossed both terrace and chainwalk. Kessa gasps a warning: experimental resonant tiles from the Foundry were diverted, their song sharp enough to shatter a rib if lined in the wrong place. The trail names a Rafter foreman—Danka Suth—and a purse stamped with the eel-skin sigil of the River Lords.",
