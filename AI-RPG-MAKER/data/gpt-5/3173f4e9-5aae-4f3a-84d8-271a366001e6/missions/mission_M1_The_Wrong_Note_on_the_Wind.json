    "description": "At the Gale Organ Cliffs, the wind runs wrong. To Scale-born ears it is a smear of tone, a three-note tremor beneath the usual drone that sets lanterns to quiver and sends riggers to make small protective signs. Aerin feels the serpent’s bones underfoot, tense as a bowstring. After the Chainhouse deaths and whispers of withheld omens, even a hesitant note could be the edge of catastrophe. Ysil Aer watches the mouth of a great pipe that exhales like a sleeping beast, robe-cords tugging in the gusts. He bids Aerin climb and listen, to gather the wind’s voice and match it against the temple’s horn-logs. Hearts in Ribcrown have grown quick with suspicion—if the Breathkeepers sound alarm without proof, they will be accused of stirring panic; if they wait, more will die. Aerin must risk the Galecliffs’ slaps and the razorkites’ shadows to find whether the wrong note comes from storm, sabotage, or something that stirs in the hollow.",

We will be accused of withholding omens again if we act on a whisper, yet I cannot ignore a chord that shivers the ribs. Go. Take the striker, and listen with the humility we swore. Bring me the wind’s memory, not rumor."
