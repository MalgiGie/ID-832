    "description": "The day of Gale Tuning dawns bright and wind-full. The city strings itself in banners and bells. At the Gale Organ Cliffs, the Breathkeepers raise their horns; at the Crown-Market, River Lords count coins with eyes on the counterweights; in the Foundry, Bonewrights lay hands on plates and whisper apologies to the bones. Ulo Hen stands with a coterie at the market’s edge, face smooth with expectation. Danka Suth lurks in the shadow of a chainhouse tug-line, hand near a hidden lever. Sorn’s wardens thin, pulled to every trouble at once. Aerin moves through the city like a thread in a worried seam: breath at the cliffs, touch at the counterweights, hand at the chain. When the five-note descent sounds under a clear sky and a hush falls, Ulo’s men spring for the levers to tilt the market, to make a riot look like physics and bury the blame in bone. But the heart-reed sings, the resonant plates are detuned and smashed, and the counterweight locks slam home by Vigil writ. Thia’s lanterns flicker signals to the rooftops; Gor’s crews seize Danka at the lever; Sera’s Bonewrights stand in a line in front of the plates, hammers raised to break their own work if needed. Ulo Hen’s smile cracks at last. Spinegate bells toll. The city breathes as one chord. Ribcrown holds.",
    "objectives": [
        "Coordinate with Breathkeepers to set a counter-tone at the Gale Organs that cancels the resonant curve planned at the market.",
        "Lead Vigil and Lantern teams to secure the counterweight locks before the signal is given.",
        "Confront Danka Suth at the Chainhouse lever; take him alive and seize his seals and correspondence.",
        "Expose Ulo Hen’s role publicly using the decoded schedule and hireblade testimony; secure his arrest in view of the Triune.",
        "Guide the city through the Tuning without panic, using the Heart-Reed Charm where needed."
