    "description": "Signal flags snap against a rising wind as a tremor passes through the Chainhouse Triad. The emergency bells beat a rhythm everyone in Ribcrown knows in their bones: something is wrong with the lift. Gor Relk does not have space for grudge now; he sends for Aerin with a jaw set to break stone. On the catwalks, sanded smooth by generations of boots, Aerin finds resonant tiles tucked under a run of plates along a curve—a knife waiting for a gale. Danka Suth’s crew works the winches, eyes too fast, one hand always near a hidden clutch. When the tremor grows to a sway and screams lift from Riverfoot, there is no good option. Aerin can trigger the emergency drop again, cost cargo and face, or try the heart-reed and pray the old tone will hold the platforms steady. In the teeth of the wind, with Thia’s runners clearing the decks and Jarik’s wardens holding the cordon, Aerin sounds the heart-tone. The Triad shudders, answers like a beast tamed by an old song, and settles. Danka runs; he leaves behind a ledger stub and the stink of brine.",
