    "description": "Spinegate Hall is a lung full of argument. The River Lords and Bonewrights spit tariffs and blame like grit; the Breathkeepers speak of omens and are mocked for it. Crowds in the Arcade strain at cordons. The prophecy Lerrin showed now beats with the city’s pulse: ‘On the day the ribs sing thrice beneath clear sky, the Seat will be filled and the Silence will speak as one, or the city will fall to its own noise.’ It is that day. Sorn Ilt looks older by years; Ysil Aer’s serenity is a taut rope. Sera Dake admits her experiment’s danger, and Ulo Hen smiles a river-knife smile. There is no accord; there is only the hollow waiting to crack. Aerin can refuse the Seat and watch the factions tear each other’s throats, or she can break taboo and sit, invoking Vaelor’s Silence, bearing the weight of atonement to come. She chooses. The bone is cold and smooth under her; the hall’s acoustics gather breath and argument into a single chord. When Aerin speaks, her voice rides the ribs. The city listens.",

        "Decide whether to sit the Seat of the Hollow and invoke Silence to still edicts and call a united action.",
        "If the Seat is taken, accept the obligation to atone publicly after the crisis as per law."

After, I will walk the ribs in atonement until my soles bleed, if that is what it takes to keep this city from falling."
