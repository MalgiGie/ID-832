    "description": "North across the scrub, the Moonshard Heath glows like frost under starlight. Shallow craters catch the sky in pale glass. Lerrin needs fresh shards to power the Archive’s cold lamps and to coax the eel-skin ledger’s last secrets from the ink it refuses to reveal. Static storms prickle the skin and snap at ropes; lunar moths flock to breath and dull the mind if you let their wings brush your eyes. Poachers prowl, eyes hungry for shards to sell to ornament-rich fools. Aerin walks the heath with Iven Rill carrying a coil of insulated line, a lantern lens ready to catch a slice of the night. When the new shard is lit and the starfield replays across the Archive ceiling, the last cipher surrenders: a schedule of counterweight shifts for the Crown-Market, disguised as constellations; a meeting at Saltlick Terraces with Danka Suth; and a final transfer meant to fund a great tilting during Gale Tuning, when the city would sing and fall together.",
