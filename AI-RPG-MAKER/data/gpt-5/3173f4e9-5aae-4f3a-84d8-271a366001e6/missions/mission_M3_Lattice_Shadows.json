    "description": "Beneath the Crown-Market Arcade, the lattice of counterweights and trussed bone-plates hums, carrying footsteps as whispers. Lantern-Queen Thia Mol meets Aerin at the edge of a smugglers’ crawl that opens between slats scraped smooth by generations of knees. She is all soft grin and hard eyes, protective of the gutterborn and tired of being the city’s favorite enemy. The Lanterns did not score the Chainhouse cables, and they did not steal a page from the horn-logs—but someone wants those stories sung until they drown out the truth. Within the crawl, a cache of forged safety seals, a ledger scrap inked with Saltlick glyphs, and a Bonewright memo stamped by Kessa Tharn are tucked in a way that says ‘planted’ to anyone who has ever run from a patrol breathless and bleeding. Mira Olt, a lamplighter with fungus-dappled sleeves, traces the crawl’s newer knots: the etchings resemble moth wings, yes, but the twists are guild-taught, Rafter-perfect.",

Someone plants our shadow and charges toll on the fear it buys. I will not answer for that with necks belonging to my children."
