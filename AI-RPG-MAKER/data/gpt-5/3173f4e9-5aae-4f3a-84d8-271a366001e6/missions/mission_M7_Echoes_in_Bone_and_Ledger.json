    "description": "The Archive’s cold lamps shed starry light across etched bone and beeswax seals. Lerrin Vale receives the eel-skin ledger with careful hands, as if it might bite. He coaxes its ink awake with moonshard glow—the letters unforget themselves, skyline of bribery in neat lines: payments to Danka Suth, to a scribe for forged seals, to ‘R. Mestri’ with an attached note, ‘Delay the breath one bell.’ Lerrin leads Aerin to the Echo Hall, where whispered names repeat hours later. He offers a memory-graft: a way to hold, for a time, the skill to read the ledger’s cipher deep; the price, as always, a cherished fragment of self. He also brings a sealed codex detailing the day Vaelor’s heart moved—from river to marsh—and a marginal prophecy naming a day when the Seat of the Hollow would be filled to save the city from its own factions. Jarik arrives mid-consultation with a Rafter’s diary torn from a dead man’s pocket, confirming the scoring marks were a signal to an insider. The shape of the plot sharpens; the choices cut.",

        "Decide whether to accept a temporary memory-graft to learn ledger-craft faster, knowing something personal will be erased.",

This ledger does not wish to be known, but it will tell its tale if we let the Moon speak to it. See? Here is ‘R. Mestri,’ here are the tides of coin, and here the note: ‘Delay the breath one bell.’ A city could drown in that bell."
