    "description": "The river falls like a held breath, and the Mistmarket Flats tremble into being. Aerin drifts among awnings and bells, past stalls selling feather-bright oils and eel-skin ledgers, following a ghost-barge whisper Thia passed along. High Bargewarden Ulo Hen plays host with a smile stapled over sharpened accounts. He would buy silence, sell a city’s patience by the dram, and dredge up an old debt owed to the ghost-barges to chain Aerin’s hands. The ghost-barge slides through fog, its crew silent as cut kelp, and offers a silver coin that takes a promise in exchange for forgetting another. Iven Rill, a cousin and river pilot with calloused hands, swears he’s seen eel-skin coin pass to a Rafter foreman named Danka Suth. Between Ulo’s leverage and the ghost-barge’s cold bargain, Aerin chooses the hard path: return stolen silver to the ghost-barge to quiet the dead debt, and pry from the Mistmarket a ledger bound in eel-skin that murmurs when warmed—the kind that forgets, unless lit by moonshard truth.",
