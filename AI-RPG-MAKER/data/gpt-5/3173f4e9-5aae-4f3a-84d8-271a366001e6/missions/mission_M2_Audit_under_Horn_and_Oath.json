    "description": "Spinegate Hall smells of bone wax and wet rope. A public audit of the temple’s horn-logs has drawn a crowd of guildsfolk, muttering and craning to see which chair of the Triune will blink first. Sorn Ilt, all plain lines and calmer voice, asks Aerin to walk the narrow line between piety and proof. The sealed logs do not match the tones Aerin caught: a page is missing, a copy is altered, and on the inside of one horn-tube a tiny moth-wing etch marks a crawlspace cut from the lattice beneath the Crown-Market Arcade. Jarik, her brother, watches her like a man waiting to catch a falling chain—ready to trust, and ready to be injured by that trust. The audit threatens to crack further the brittle peace between Vigil, Breathkeepers, River Lords, and Rafter Guild.",

        "Inspect the Aeric Aerie horn-tubes for signs of tampering; document the moth-wing etch.",
