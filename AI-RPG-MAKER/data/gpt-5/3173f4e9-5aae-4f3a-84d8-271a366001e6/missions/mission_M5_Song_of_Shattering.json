    "description": "The Foundry-Kilns glow like banked suns, breathing salt-ash and promise. On the test-wall where Bonewrights hammer new plates ‘to song,’ Aerin arranges a sanctioned demonstration with Sera Dake and Gor Relk. The resonant tiles, pale and subtly grooved, hum sweet when struck—and then too sweet, overtone climbing until plates squeal and microfractures creep like frost. Gor Relk’s jaw hardens; it is his crews who ride the chains, his dead who swung off cables cut by scored sheaths. He hates the Lanterns for the moth-marks and Aerin for the emergency drop that cost him face, but he hates bad craft worse. The demonstration makes clear how a few tiles, placed just so along a curve, could turn the ribs against themselves under gale pressure. The quiet conclusion: Danka Suth did not act alone. Someone wealthy enough to buy eel-skin silver, bold enough to manipulate foundry requisitions, cunning enough to mark moth-wings under a chainwalk.",
    "objectives": [
        "Acquire a sample of the experimental resonant tiles under Conclave supervision.",
        "Set up and conduct the test-wall demonstration with Sera Dake and Gor Relk present.",
        "Document how overtone climbs when tiles are aligned along a curve; secure fragments as evidence.",
        "Win begrudging permission from Gor Relk to inspect Chainhouse catwalks for similar placement."

            "line": "You’ll hear it first, then see it crack. These tiles hum pretty until you set them along a curve. Then the song climbs like a blade and the wall answers with spider-veins. It’s not a prayer, Gor. It’s a trap set to spring when the wind rises."
