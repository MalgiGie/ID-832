"{\n  \"city\": \"Ribcrown is a cliff-suspended metropolis strung through the arched ribs of the slain sky-serpent Vaelor, spanning the thunder of the Anther River where it carves the deep Mothravine. The first lashings were rope-bridges and tarred rafts slung between pale bone ninety cubits above the flood; over three centuries, those lashings gave way to ironwood struts, bone-ceramic plates, and wind-braced chains until markets, homes, temples, and ropeways wove a city among the ribs.\\n\\nHistory and founding: Ribcrown rose 312 years ago when refugees of the Moonfall Deluge followed storm-omens into the canyon and found Vaelor’s exposed skeleton ringing like chimes in the wind. Legend says the serpent died to pin the river in place, sacrificing itself so the waters would never again devour the highlands. The earliest families—river pilots, salt-gardeners, and ridge-rope makers—bound themselves by a ‘Hollow Oath’ to never cut Vaelor’s bones, only to carve grooves and plug fittings where marrow had long since petrified. The oath remains binding law.\\n\\nDistricts: Crownward (uppermost ribs with the old guildhalls and roosted manses); Midspans (broadest decks where the Crown-Market Arcade hangs like a bright net of banners); Undershadows (lower galleries and ropewalks, where lanterns stay lit even at noon); Spinegate (civic chambers and archives carved into the central vertebrae); Riverfoot (the stacked docks and floodgates at canyon floor); Galecliffs (windmill terraces and the chainhouses pinned into the cliff’s dark basalt).\\n\\nEconomy: Bone-ceramic craft from the Bonewright Foundry-Kilns; wind-pressed oils and milled grains from cliff-farms; river trade brokered at Riverfoot Locks and the seasonal Mistmarket; fungal silk and medicinal spores from the Ossuary Gardens; luminescent crystal from the Moonshard Heath; basalt and obsidian from the western Reach. Ribcrown imports timber, tin rivets, and pitch, and exports bone-inlaid instruments, chainwork, wind-harps, and lantern-glass.\\n\\nGovernment: The city is governed by the Triune Charter—three signatories who must concur for new law: the Bonewrights’ Conclave (craft and infrastructure), the River Lords’ Compact (trade and tollage), and the Breathkeepers of the Unbroken Breath (ritual and safety in gale season). A ritual empty chair, the Seat of the Hollow, stands between them in Spinegate Hall. Any edict can be stilled for one lunar month if all three invoke Vaelor’s Silence, a veto in the serpent’s name; doing so twice in a year requires public atonement on the ribs.\\n\\nLaws and taboos: No severing of Vaelor’s bones; no fire on the ribs without guard-pans; no tolling the wind-horns in clear weather; spore masks required in the Undershadows during Sporefall; river pilots hold right-of-way at floodrise. Violations are reviewed by Vigil of the Hollow magistrates.\\n\\nFestivals: Gale Tuning (when the wind-organs at the Gale Organ Cliffs are tuned and the city sings); The Lanterning (the first night the Mistmarket appears, when the riverfolk drift by and trade under floating lights); Spine Remembering (names of the lost are threaded in wind-chimes along a rib and cut free at dawn).\\n\\nDependencies and vulnerabilities: The Foundry-Kilns depend on salt-ash from the Saltlick Terraces; the Chainhouse Triad rides on basalt from the Obsidian Reach; the Marrow Archive requires moonshards for their cold lamps; Riverfoot’s trade depends on sandbar stability at the Mistmarket Flats. A drought upriver starves the docks; a gale-season landslide can isolate Crownward; and some whisper that when the ribs hum in a three-note pattern before a storm, the serpent stirs.\\n\\nLegends and omens: The Breathkeepers say Vaelor is not wholly dead; its heart was ferried to the Elderbarrow Marsh and buried beneath a mound that grows warm before floods. River-born children who bear a crescent birthmark behind the ear—the Scale-born—can allegedly hear the bones sing. The Moth Lanterns retell an older tale still: that Vaelor hunted the moon and swallowed a shard of it, and that the Moonshard Heath is its shed glimmer.\\n\\nPresent tensions: A tariff war brews between Bonewrights and River Lords over weight-fees in the Crown-Market Arcade; the Rafter Guild blames the Moth Lanterns for sabotage that stalled the Chainhouse Triad and killed three riggers; the Breathkeepers are accused of withholding a storm-omen after Gale Tuning, and the Vigil of the Hollow must choose between keeping the peace and keeping the Triune from cracking.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Elderbarrow Marsh\",\n      \"type\": \"marsh and burial islets\",\n      \"distance\": \"two days south along the floodplain by barge\",\n      \"description\": \"A tangle of reed-choked channels and silt islets crowned with ancient stone mounds.
