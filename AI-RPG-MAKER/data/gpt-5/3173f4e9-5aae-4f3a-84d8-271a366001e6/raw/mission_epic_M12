Banners bite the wind between ribs, bells kiss and ring, and the ribs themselves hum a faint expectation that presses against the teeth when one smiles. On the Crown-Market Arcade, counterweights hang like sleeping moons while tally-scribes drag chalk across slate and River Lords whisper over ledgers bright with eel-skin sheen. In the Foundry-Kilns, Bonewrights lay work-rough hands on pale plates and murmur to the bones, promising steadiness if steadiness is asked of them. The Temple’s horns glint along the Gale Organ Cliffs, and Breathkeepers in storm-blue bind their hair and set their hands to reeds and tone-cords, listening for the river’s far-off temper as if for a child’s cough in a crowded room. Aerin Rell moves between all of it as if her feet know every plank by memory and every rope by name, a paladin carrying the hush before a thunderclap; the moonshard lantern at her hip answers the organ caves with a faint, kind hum. Ulo Hen stands at the market’s edge with a smile too still to be safe, and his hireblades stand like polite shadows that forgot how to blink. Danka Suth keeps to a tug-line gallery above the Chainhouse Triad with grease on his knuckles and a lever’s bite already weeping against his palm, shame wrapped in stubbornness like wire in pitch. When the sky is clean and the organ should sing only a bright weaving of festival notes, a five-note descent slides through the stone like a wet knife, and every trained ear in Ribcrown turns toward it with the same thought: this is the storm’s voice, but there is no storm. The tilt ready to be blamed on physics is a human plan with a counterfeit wind for its herald, a resonance engineered like a trap’s jaw. Sorn’s wardens are spread thin as oaths stretched on too many hooks, and the Vigil’s lamplighters run hot-footed along the ribs with the edict rolled under an arm and fear tucked under the tongue. Thia’s lanterns pass quick signals in the lattice, little pulses of meaning that wink across shingles and bone as if moths carry law instead of light. Gor Relk’s crews knot their lines and anchor boots, and Sera Dake’s Bonewrights stand before their plates ready to smash their own craft rather than let it turn murderous. High Cantor Ysil Aer listens, chin lifted to the wind as if smelling rain, and makes a sign over the Breath Gong that is not yet rung. The city inhales together, and Aerin hears the serpent’s hollow carry both the lie and the cure. Tonight the city will sing, but only if its hearts agree to breathe as one.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Coordinate with the Breathkeepers at the Gale Organ Cliffs and call a deliberate counter-tone that unknots the forged resonance laid to tilt the Crown-Market, canceling the curve without cracking nerves.\",\n        \"Lead mixed teams from the Vigil and the Moth Lanterns through lattice and catwalk to reach the Crown-Market counterweight housings and secure every lock before the false signal is thrown.\",\n        \"Climb to the Chainhouse tug-line galleries and confront Danka Suth at the primed lever; turn his hand from sabotage, take him alive, and seize his seals, letters, and any ciphered correspondence.\",\n        \"Expose Ulo Hen’s orchestration in public sight using the decoded schedule, ledgers, and hireblade testimony; set the words in the air where the Triune and the market can hear, and secure his arrest without blood.\",\n        \"Guide Ribcrown through Gale Tuning without panic by pacing announcements, holding a steady presence on the ribs, and sounding the Heart-Reed Charm where needed to settle crowds into one breath instead of many shouts.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sorn Ilt\", \"lines\": \"Listen close, all of you, because the city cannot afford a second telling while the wind plays tricks. The Triune has signed the emergency edict and put it in my keeping, and I am putting it in yours, Aerin, because the ribs listen when you walk them. We are spread so thin a stiff word might cut us, and every faction thinks their problem is the only fire worth water. You will make your moves clean, you will name your intentions before you act, and you will keep your people’s hands low unless blood spills. If we do this right, the only thing the market remembers is a song that steadied their feet, a lever that never moved, and a warden who took a smile off a merchant’s face without breaking his jaw. I will be the ugly voice at Spinegate if things turn, but I would rather be the echo of your calm than the bell after the fall.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Thia Mol\", \"lines\": \"Lanterns, hear me and hold your blades like secrets you do not wish to tell. Today we are chorus, not dagger, and a chorus holds a city on the breath between notes when fear would make fools of everyone. Blink the rooftop code so clean a lamplighter could copy it blind, and keep the crawls open for Vigil boots whether they say thank you or not. If someone comes for us with iron in their eyes, we will defend our own, but not before the counterweights are locked, not before the children on the Arcade feel the deck stand still under them. Aerin has risked more for us than most who wear crests, and today we risk for the city by making sure no one has to see what we are capable of in the dark. When the five-note lie tries to own the air, we answer with lantern-light and quiet hands and leave no purchase for panic to climb.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Gor Relk\", \"lines\": \"Danka, I have buried men for less than the shadow you cast on my crews, but I have also fed the widows of fools who didn’t know how to quit a bad plan. You bleed Guild blood and you were made by ropes that sing when the wind strikes them, so do not stain that with coin someone tossed you like offal. Drop the lever, look me in the eye, and tell me who met you under the brake drums and taught you the cuts; I can smell the foreign pitch from here. Three riggers died because someone made a mark shaped like a moth and hoped I’d light the city on fire to cook the truth, and I will not be their fourth mistake. You know how many hands it takes to keep one platform true in a crosswind, so imagine how many it takes to hold a city steady; do not make us use all of them to pry your fingers loose. If you make me drag you, I will, and I will keep you alive because the Vigil asked it and because I want you to hear the names at Spine Remembering with your own ears.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ulo Hen\", \"lines\": \"This is not the place for theater, Paladin, and certainly not the time to make trade into a mask you can point at and call a villain. Trade is breath, and the market is the lung that keeps this cliff from sleeping, and you do not arrest breath because it frightens you when it comes fast. You stand in festival blue and speak about oaths, but the only oath that keeps children fed is the ledger’s promise to pay at dusk. You mistake mechanism for malice because you wear iron on your conscience where others wear coin, and the city should not be made to sway to one woman’s moral music. If the counterweights were to move, it would be physics and timing, and the people would learn a lesson about balance written by the wind and not by your sanctimony.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aerin Rell\", \"lines\": \"I was born where the lamps never went out because darkness had learned our stair, and I have breathed the bones since I was old enough to listen for the first creak before a fall. Trade is current and it turns the wheels; breath is breath and it belongs to us all, and if you have to steal air to buy a better rate, your math is murder. The Hollow Oath does not say we are above need, it says we do not cut bone, and your tricks take a saw to every trust that holds us. By the echo of the Seat and the taste of Oathwater fresh on my tongue, by the ledger you tried to drown in moonlight and the hireblade who could not stand the way his own son looked at him, I name your plan and I refuse it. Sorn, take him when the crowd can see his smile crack and know it for what it is. And if the wind tries to lie again with a fifth note sliding where none belongs, I will answer with the Heart-Reed and give the city a true chord to stand on.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ysil Aer\", \"lines\": \"Hear the Hollow and heed the wind, because the wind tells the truth even when men lay notes like snares inside it. A counter-tone is not a shout; it is a cupped hand around a frightened candle, it is a palm against a panicked chest counting to four and back again. We will sing in the intervals that make stone remember its patience, and we will not ring the Breath Gong unless the sky itself bares its teeth. Aerin, stand at the second mouth and let your lantern answer the cave, because the moonshard knows how to hold a starfield still when the night would smear it. We do not drown men today, not in water, not in noise, and not in the cleverness of their own schemes. Let the last note fall into relief rather than mourning, and let the people think only of how good it felt to breathe together.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sera Dake\", \"lines\": \"My hands have learned every way bone-ceramic can crack, from pride to haste to the wrong song in a midday heat, and I will not let my plates be made accomplices to cowardice. The Hollow Oath binds my guild to brace the hollow that holds us, and if bracing today means breaking what we made before it breaks someone’s mother, then we will break it with love and name the shards after those we spared. I have tuned these tiles to hum true with Vaelor’s quiet, and I can detune them with one strike that changes the city’s weight by less than a breath but keeps a swindle from becoming a disaster. Stand with us in a line and watch our hammers stay low unless the signal flies, because craft is patience, not panic. When the Vigil calls for the locks to bite, they will bite; and if the market tries to tilt, it will find my plates have learned to refuse the wrong dance.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Danka Suth\", \"lines\": \"I have stood on these galleries since I had to wrap the ropes twice round my wrist to feel strong enough, and I have watched men fall who deserved a rope and not a prayer. They came to me with coin, yes, but also with names I recognized from the docks, and they spoke of my sister’s debt like it was a wind I could not tack against if I did not learn a new song. I told myself it was only a lever and physics and that Gor would shout and the market would sway and the day would end with nothing worse than a scare and a new purse. But when the organ sang the five notes in a sky that wore no cloud, I thought of the children who run the lantern-lattice like it was a game, and I felt sick to my fingers. I am not brave enough to be the villain you need me to be, and I am not clean enough to be the hero you are; take me alive if you must, and I will put names in your hand that make my stomach turn.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Jarik Rell\", \"lines\": \"Little sister, I have known your stubbornness since you refused to be carried up the ribs and made me tie a harness you could walk with while our mother cursed and laughed through her teeth. The law is a rope that burns if you grab it too late, and you have a habit of seizing lines that are not yours because the wind has frightened you with the truth you hear. Sorn has given you the edict and that means you carry the city’s face today, so make certain the city likes what it sees when it looks in your eyes. I will post wardens where your shadow lengthens and I will take the blame if someone needs a name to throw at a wall, but I ask you to remember the promise you once made me about naming any saboteur you found. Do not let mercy become a silence that costs lives, and do not let anger make you forget why you broke a law once to save children who still remember your voice in their sleep.\"\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"CH1\", \"title\": \"Sing Against the Storm\", \"text\": \"You choose the cliffs first and climb to the organ mouths, trusting your line to bite and your legs to listen to the wind’s sideways speech. Ysil Aer sets you at the second mouth where the stone breathes with a deeper patience, and you let the moonshard lantern hum while your palm learns the reed’s temper. The five-note descent tries to lower the city’s spine, but you answer with a measured interval that turns falling into landing and teaches the echo not to panic. Breathkeepers steady your count with the striker’s patient tap, and the air grows dense with relief as if a held sob has found a shoulder. You send a lantern-pulse downhill to Thia and Sorn and feel the city’s tension shift like a ship coming about on a new tack. Somewhere behind you someone weeps because the sky did not lie a second time, and the wind seems almost grateful that you asked it to be honest.\", \"outcome\": \"The Crown-Market’s pulse slows two beats and never reaches the speed a stampede would need, and families remember a smooth sway where panic might have gripped ankles. With the resonance unknotted, Sera Dake’s plates remain whole and Gor’s crews find the locks ready to bite without strain, and the counterweights take their duty like old, content oxen. Ulo Hen feels the moment to pretend physics has gone rogue pass like a fish that refuses a hook, and his smile betrays him as the crowd watches him look for a lever that never moves. The Vigil snags his hireblades’ testimony after the first one’s eyes break under the weight of the lie, and the decoded schedule reads aloud like a confession sung on the wrong key. Your name rides the wind in gratitude rather than argument, and the Triune’s later accolades find a crowd already nodding, which means the city accepts that what you wield is calm rather than force.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"CH2\", \"title\": \"Lock the Market\", \"text\": \"You run the ribwalk toward the Crown-Market, eating the distance in long steps and trusting Ysil to hold the hollow’s song long enough for you to seize iron. Thia’s signals flash at the lattice’s edge, and her people blend into the crowd like stitches that disappear once they’ve done their healing. Gor’s riggers make room without argument, and you smell old pitch and fear and cinnamon from a spice stall as you drop into the counterweight housings with your shield already warming near false testimony. The first lock shudders like a spooked animal, but your hands talk to it with patience, and the second snaps home with a sound that makes the nearby vendors laugh, the way laughter comes when a thing you feared proves to be only a cupboard door. When the five-note lie touches the ribs, the locks do not answer, and people feel the deck stand steady under them like a friend’s hand on a shoulder. You rise into light with grease on your gauntlet and a grin that you do not show, because the crowd needs stillness more than it needs spectacle.\", \"outcome\": \"The Arcade never tilts and the counterweights become the heroes no one names, which is exactly the kind of heroics a city can live with. A few shove-matches die before they’re born because Thia’s lanterns grin and shake their heads instead of baring steel, and the Vigil posts writs on the housings that make the River Lords look like they tried to tax gravity. Ulo steps forward to claim an inspection concern at precisely the wrong moment, and the hush that greets him is not a silence but a verdict; when Sorn reads the edict, the crowd is already nodding toward the restraints that saved them. Danka is taken alive three decks away with his lips trying to form lies his lungs no longer support, and his seals open letters that set ink-fingered proofs on the scales. When Spinegate’s bells toll, they sound like applause to those with hearts still hammering, and the city’s memory of you is of hands that tightened bolts rather than fists that swung.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"CH3\", \"title\": \"Mercy at the Lever\", \"text\": \"You meet Danka’s eyes the way a rigger meets a bad knot, with patience and a refusal to pretend it is something else. Your voice does not climb; it goes low and slow, and you talk about how many hands it takes to keep a platform true when the wind wants to pull it loose. You say his sister’s name like you would say a prayer you learned from watching a woman patch an old coat by lamplight, and you admit you are not here to save his pride but to save his life and the lives it would spill. You share a piece of your own shame—how you pulled the emergency clutch and dropped a platform you could not save—and you own the cost so he can own his choice without drowning in what will follow. You keep speaking even as his fingers twitch and the lever hums like a sleeping snake, and you let the Heart-Reed’s low note warm the air between you until a man who came to be useful to someone else remembers he is useful to his own name. When his hand lets go, it is not a surrender to you, it is a surrender to himself, and that is why the chains do not shake.\", \"outcome\": \"Danka surrenders without blood and begs you to keep him from Gor’s rage long enough to speak truth in a room with ink and witnesses, and you keep that promise because promises keep you. His seals open letters that sketch the bribe-path with the patience of a cartographer, and one hireblade breaks at the sight of an old signature and admits the timing signals that would have wrapped physics around a lie. Gor stands three strides away like a storm willing to turn back to rain if the roofs hold, and Thia’s lanterns step between anger and its excuse without anyone losing face. Ulo Hen watches his last pawn step off the board and remembers how to sweat in cool weather, and the market hears you say that mercy is not silence but the thing that lets truth be heard. At Spinegate, the Triune hears this tale with the city’s breath unbroken, and no one doubts that a lever could have stolen a morning because everyone watched it fail to do so.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"CH4\", \"title\": \"Steel at the Lever\", \"text\": \"You do not have time for a man’s better angels to find their wings, so you strike like a rigger saving a friend from a slip he will not survive. Your shield pins the lever arm and bites between gear-teeth with a grating sound that makes cowards think of broken teeth, and your gauntlet takes Danka’s wrist in a grip that teaches him how such bones were meant to be used. You twist, you step, and you let the rope around your waist hold the two of you while the gallery quivers with startled breath. A short prayer rides your breath as you bind his hand, not for him but for the children on the Arcade and for the dead who will not need new names today. Danka shouts half a promise and half a curse, and you tell him promises do not count when they are made in the act of falling. When the five-note lie slinks out across the ribs, the lever is already asleep and the gallery learns a lesson about how quickly mercy can move when it wears steel.\", \"outcome\": \"The lever never drops and the Chainhouse crews break into a relieved laugh that sounds like a sob learning to smile, and Danka lives because you took him rather than let him take himself. He curses until Sorn lays the edict across his pride and then he speaks, and his words name Ulo and the schedule with a defeated relief that makes angry men glance away. Gor Relk grinds his jaw but does not claim the right to justice he could have demanded, because you did not make him choose between vengeance and the city. Thia’s people calm a ripple of rumor about the roughness of the arrest before it can grow teeth, and Sera’s Bonewrights never have to test their hammers against their own craft. The city reads strength without cruelty in your choices, and that memory becomes a handhold when the Triune later asks it to trust you with a broader oath.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"CH5\", \"title\": \"Expose Ulo on the Arcade\", \"text\": \"You climb a stall and take the high edge of a weighing ring so the market can see you and hear you without reaching for gossip like a weapon.

You hold up the seals and the eel-skin ledgers and the letters that were meant to travel by ghost-barge and never see sun, and you let the Oathstone in your shield warm the crowd with the honest ache it knows. You lay no poetry on the moment, because poetry is what villains have already tried to sell the city, and instead you give them the plainness of a lever and a lie and the price they were meant to pay for someone else’s profit. When Sorn steps onto the ring with the edict in his hand, the crowd is already a witness that wants to sign its name, and Ulo’s smile looks like a mask that forgot its strings. Ysil’s distant counter-tone makes the air feel sane, and you finish with the Heart-Reed’s breath so the city can hear itself say yes.\", \"outcome\": \"Ulo Hen is arrested in the full sight of the Crown-Market, and the River Lords’ remaining allies decide they love their families more than their patron and step back to let the Vigil pass. Hireblades hand over their employers’ phrases, which fit into place like well-cut tiles, and the decoded timing daisy-chains through the afternoon’s ledger in a way any scribe can follow. The Bonewrights do not have to break a single plate, but they stand ready, and the sight of craft prepared to sacrifice itself makes the crowd generous and quiet instead of hungry and cruel. The Triune’s representatives observe without interruption, and their later judgment wears a face the people have already accepted. The Arcade remains the place where the city buys its bread and not the field where it learned to riot, and your voice is remembered as the tone that let everyone listen without choosing a side before the truth had time to land.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"CH6\", \"title\": \"Name Ulo at Spinegate\", \"text\": \"You carry the proofs into the vertebra where law wears bone and echoes answer lies with long patience, and you let the market finish breathing before you start the city thinking. The Seat of the Hollow watches without eyes while you set seals and letters like small weights on an old scale, and every clink feels like a breath finally released. You ask the Vigil to speak first so that Sorn’s plain voice plows the soil where your words will seed, and then you offer the hireblades’ testimony in the order that makes their courage easier to keep. You do not thunder because thunder is for storms, and the sky is clear, so you let your grief do the work and trust that the city knows the taste of it. When the five-note lie fades at last into a strengthless suggestion far above, the Hall breathes as one and the prophecy no one quotes today remembers how to sleep. You end by naming the Heart-Reed not as charm but as promise, and people who have never held one feel their lungs learn a new way to count.\", \"outcome\": \"Ulo’s arrest is a civic act instead of a spectacle, and the River Lords who might have taken insult find relief in the way the law wraps them instead of pelts them. The Triune concurs without invoking Vaelor’s Silence, and the decision does not need a bell to make itself heard, because the Hall itself seems to consent. The market hears the news when it is ready to call it news and not rumor, and no one has to put a foot wrong to see the day turned safe. Danka’s confession arrives with him alive and guarded, and it threads into the record as neatly as any ledger line, undoing the bribe network like a calm hand undoing a braid.
