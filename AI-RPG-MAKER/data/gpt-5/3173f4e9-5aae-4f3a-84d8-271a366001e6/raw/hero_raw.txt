As a Scale-born, she could hear tones others missed, and the Breathkeepers marked her early as a ward during gale season. When a floodrise nearly tore Riverfoot free, she broke the taboo against tolling horn in clear weather to summon crews and saved a dozen children; instead of punishment, High Cantor Ysil Aer guided her to swear a variant of the Hollow Oath as a paladin of the Unbroken Breath, binding her life to the safety of Ribcrown and the sanctity of Vaelor's remains. She trained on the Gale Organ Cliffs, learned the wind-rites, and served as mediator between dockers, riggers, and market scribes. When the Chainhouse Triad suffered fatal cable scoring, Aerin rode a platform during a night patrol and discovered saboteur marks shaped like moth wings under a catwalk. Refusing a rush to scapegoat the Moth Lanterns, she pulled the emergency clutch to drop an unmanned platform, sacrificing a shipment and her standing with the Rafter Guild but saving the system from catastrophic failure. Her brother, Jarik Rell of the Vigil, pressed her to name the culprits; Aerin held her tongue, believing there was a deeper hand behind the marks. Since then she has brokered quiet truces on the Crown-Market, ferried storm-warnings upriver, and taken on a ghost-barge debt to protect Scale-born gutter kids hidden by the Lanterns. She walks the ribs as living oath and shield while the Triune Charter strains, seeking the true note beneath the noise.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Oathplate Shield\",\n      \"description\": \"Bone-ceramic shield etched with wind-tone grooves that vibrate under gale pressure and deflect falling debris; inlaid with a small oathstone that warms near false testimony.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chainhook Glaive\",\n      \"description\": \"A polearm favored by riggers and wardens with a recurved hook for catching cables and a weighted butt for bracing on swaying decks.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Moonshard Lantern\",\n      \"description\": \"Cold-light lantern whose lens can replay starfields recorded on the Moonshard Heath; doubles as a signal to river pilots when shaded to specific tones.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Sporemask of the Ossuary\",\n      \"description\": \"Fungal silk respirator treated with antibiotic shelf fungus, fitted with a bone ring stamped by the Vigil for lawful passage during Sporefall.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Breathkeeper Rite-Striker\",\n      \"description\": \"Hand chime and striker used to call and count wind notes during patrols; illegal to sound outside ritual, though Aerin once did to save lives.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Rigger’s Line and Grip\",\n      \"description\": \"Coil of waxed cord and an obsidian-toothed clamp for emergency traverses beneath decks and along lattice crawls.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 14,\n    \"agility\": 11,\n    \"constitution\": 15,\n    \"intelligence\": 11,\n    \"wisdom\": 14,\n    \"charisma\": 13,\n    \"dexterity\": 12,\n    \"endurance\": 15,\n    \"perception\": 13,\n    \"luck\": 9\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Mediation between rival guilds\",\n    \"Wind-rite etiquette and omen reading\",\n    \"Ropeway and chainhouse safety\",\n    \"Riverfolk customs and toll-law\",\n    \"De-escalation under crowd pressure\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Thia Mol\": \"An uneasy ally and confidant; Aerin shielded the Lantern-Queen from a false charge after the Chainhouse deaths and secretly owes her a ghost-barge favor tied to protecting Scale-born children.\",\n    \"Jarik Rell\": \"Older brother and Vigil warden; respects Aerin’s courage but distrusts her secrecy about the saboteurs.
