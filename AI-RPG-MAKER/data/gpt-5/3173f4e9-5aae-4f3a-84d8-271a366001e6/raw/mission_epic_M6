The Mistmarket Flats quickened under lanterns and bells, a flotilla of tethered sandbars blooming into aisles of eel-skin ledgers, windharp tins, and steaming bowls of saltwort stew. Aerin Rell stepped from plank to trembling plank with the balance of a cliff-born soul, the hum of her moonshard lantern answering the distant organ-notes from the Galecliffs like a remembered lullaby. She had followed a whisper sent by Thia Mol, the Lantern-Queen whose secrets cut as clean as obsidian and whose mercy kept gutter kids from the river's mouth, and the whisper named a ghost-barge and a debt that would drag the living down by the hair if not made right. High Bargewarden Ulo Hen stood near the depth-mark poles with a host's grin and an accountant's eyes, his awning hung with weighing rings that gleamed like shackles polished for festival. He spoke in river-proverbs and toll-law clauses, offering cups foamed with courtesy and ropes braided from obligations, and he drew attention without ever lifting his voice. But through the fog-shift, something darker slid: a barge with no sound but the touch of keel on mist, crewmen pale as hoarfrost, and a coin-box of silver that the lantern-folk said bought forgetfulness like a surgeon's knife buys quiet. A cousin, Iven Rill, river shoulders and calloused palms, swore he had watched an eel-skin purse pass to Danka Suth, a Rafter foreman with cable grease under his nails, and the purse paid for a sluice trick that tipped the locks and beached a rival's trade. The ledger that hummed when warmed, the ledger that swallowed names unless rinsed in moonlight, lay somewhere beneath awnings and smiles, and it bore a careful initial, an 'R. Mestri', like a seed under frost. Between Ulo's leverage and the ghost-barge's price, Aerin set herself like a wedge in swollen wood, determined to return stolen silver, to keep her oaths from being braided into someone else's rope, and to draw the hidden names into the cold, true light.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Meet Ulo Hen at the Riverfoot stall and deflect his attempt to bind you by debt.\",\n        \"Seek the ghost-barge before dawn bells and offer back the stolen silver on someone else’s behalf.\",\n        \"Secure the eel-skin ledger that records payments to Danka Suth and an initial to ‘R.

A ghost-barge sent a signal only fools or the desperate answer, and I count you as neither, which is why I am asking, not ordering, you to hear me before you step into its wake. There is silver abroad that makes room by carving out a promise you meant to keep, and the river loves nothing so much as a hollow it can fill, so mind the hollows of your heart. Ulo will smile as if selling you air, and he will try to fold your oath into his ledger like another figure to be balanced at season’s end. If you must trade, trade back what was stolen; if you must promise, promise only to the bones and the breath, and let the dead keep their own commerce. Return the coin to the water it came from and you may free a child from a noose you cannot see. But if you take the forgetting for yourself, you will pay for it with a hole that whistles when the wind turns, and I will not be able to patch that sound with lantern-light. Remember this too: the eel-skin books murmur to warmth like hatchlings to a mother, and your moonshard carries a colder truth than any scribe’s seal.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ulo Hen\", \"lines\": \"Paladin of the wind and the vigilant eye, come share a cup whose price the river already paid; after all, everything flows, including grudges and gratitude. I hear you prefer debts that wash clean in fog, and I am a bargewarden who relishes clean ledgers, so perhaps we can do each other a pious kindness and let the current carry off some inconvenient stones. Names need not be spoken for a city to keep balance, and balance is what I offer, a steady beam against the scale of passions that would tilt this Arcade into riot and ruin. You bring the breath, I bring the boats, and between us the market will not hyperventilate, though a little quickened pulse does keep folk buying. You know the law that lives between lines, and I know the lines that pull the law along, so let us pull together, and I will forget a weight that would otherwise press your friends flat. If there were a ledger singing in eel-skin somewhere near at hand, why, it would only be singing a song of normal business, and the river sings louder. Take this courtesy note and a smile, and we shall say that the wind blew the wrong way tonight and no one is to blame; what is a promise compared to a season of smooth tollage. And if you must make a show for the Vigil, make it, for I have nothing to fear from daylight that is not already reflected in my account books.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ghost-Barge Ferryman\", \"lines\": \"Silver returns to silver, and the river remembers where each coin sank, though it makes a polite show of forgetting so the living can sleep. We trade in the debts that fall between words, and we settle oaths with the gravity of stones thrown under moonlight, not with the ink that merchants wear like perfume. Take this coin and hold it until your mouth shapes a promise you never meant to barter, and we will kindly tuck that promise away so you can keep breathing when the wind goes out. Or bring us the stolen piece of our night, and we will clap it back into the coffer that keeps the dead from clinking at your heels, and a lantern will burn on a night you cannot see. We ask no names when the fog is honest, but the fog is not honest tonight, and there are initials in the air that try to pass for silence. Your lantern hums with frost and memory; warm the eel-skin and the book will murmur to you like a babe, and then close it before the market hears its own heartbeat in fear. Remember, Scale-born, the bones sing truer than silver, but silver buys time, and time buys breath, and breath buys courage, and all of it washes down to us at the end.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iven Rill\", \"lines\": \"I saw it plain as the paint on the depth-mark poles, Aerin, and I’m not the sort to gild a rope with lies when wind is already high. Danka Suth stood with his glove off, counting with thumb and two fingers like a man who grew up tallying bolts, and an eel-skin purse fat as a festival eel slid into his palm as casual as a handshake. A scribe with River Lords colors lingered close enough to smell the pitch on his cuffs, and when the signal flag dipped twice, the hidden sluice cut a handspan off the river and beached Sevrin’s barge like a carp on a rock. They bought his cargo for a prayer and a shrug while the lock-crews pretended to check rope friction, and the men who should have shouted just looked at their boots and waited for the water to come back. I caught sight of the ledger when they warmed it over a kettle to check a figure; it shivered and hummed like something alive and I swear I saw an initial, an R carved with care right after a Mestri squiggle, neat as a clerk’s conscience. I’ll say it under oath and I’ll face Ulo’s stare with empty hands if I have to, because I’ve piloted in the dark and that kind of trick is the sort that makes widows and orphans without leaving a storm to blame. You get that ledger, and I’ll walk it to Spinegate with you, and if the Vigil wants more than my word I’ll take them to the sluice and show them the trick like a man showing a scar he’s tired of hiding.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Danka Suth\", \"lines\": \"You come at me with fog-stories and eel-skin whispers, paladin, while my crews tie their lives to cable that sings in the wind like a blade badly sheathed. Three of ours went down when someone scored the line, and folk still point to moth-wing scratches under a catwalk like a sermon they don’t understand, so forgive me if I do not bow to lantern gossip. I shake hands with dockers and I count bolts with scribes because the Chainhouse stands or falls on more than prayer, and I’ll not have the Guild hung by some market stunt dressed up as righteousness. If a purse passed, it passed lawfully for labor rendered, and if a ledger hummed, perhaps it had a song to keep men awake in a job that kills the drowsy; I have heard stranger rituals sanctioned by your Breathkeepers. As for sluices, the Locks are River Lords’ ground, and I would sooner kiss a razorkite than meddle there without a line of writ; if someone cut the water, let Ulo’s lot answer for it in Spinegate not in the shoving circle of a fair. Now, you bring me proof that has weight like a counterstone, not fog in your palm, and I will stand with you against whoever is cutting deals that beach decent work. Until then, mind where you plant your pike, because ropes carry sound and my people are tired of hearing their dead blamed for every shiver in the chains.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C1\", \"title\": \"Weigh the Smile with Wind\", \"text\": \"You refuse Ulo Hen’s courtesy with ritual calm, and you ask the breath to weigh his words the way the organs weigh a storm. You raise your rite-striker and click the count for clear-weather tones, careful to keep within the law while letting the Arcade hear the measure of your poise. You speak of the Hollow Oath and of debts that must be aired, invoking the Seat of the Hollow not as a threat but as a reminder that silence has a cost. You let the market know you will not name names in a crowd, yet you promise that any ledger that forgets on purpose will remember under moonlight, and you can already feel your lantern’s cold hum answer that promise. You watch his smile thin as a scoured sandbar, and you watch the scribes around him exchange the glances of men who suddenly find themselves on a stage they did not choose.\", \"outcome\": \"Ulo does not lash out, but his charm hardens and his stallers exchange their eel-skin tallies for safer parchment as if paper could absorb shame. The crowd’s mood shifts from appetite to attention, and the Vigil wardens nearby relax their hands on cudgels because a public crack has opened where a riot might have. Ulo withdraws his attempt to bind you by debt with a toast and a bow that hold as many knives as courtesies, and he promises a private parley at dawn that you do not intend to keep. News of your restraint travels on the ribs, and Bonewright inspectors nod at you in the lanes while River Lords tally-scribes begin copying ledgers twice to get ahead of a storm they cannot read. You gain no immediate proof, but you deflect the trap and earn enough quiet to move toward the ghost-barge without a chain around your ankle.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C2\", \"title\": \"Drink the Toll and Bide Your Time\", \"text\": \"You accept Ulo Hen’s cup and his practiced generosity, letting the taste of brine-sweet cordial rest on your tongue like a small lie you will not swallow. You pretend to consider a balancing favor while your eyes count signals, gloves, and the shadow of a courier under the awning’s edge. You request a courtesy chit for emergency passage, dressed as a mutual kindness between safety and commerce, and you let him believe you are willing to fence with ledgers instead of laws. You ask for a ledger’s page in exchange for discretion, suggesting that keeping the Arcade calm is worth a little tidying across the numbers. You remind him that a paladin can be a cork in the bottle or a hammer on the seal, and let him decide which drink he wants to keep from spilling.\", \"outcome\": \"Ulo plays along and presses a weighted token into your palm, a small circle keyed to the Locks that will open gates in a pinch, and you file its feel away for a darker day. He promises a page but delivers a list of fluctuations that says everything without saying anything, a polite wall that buys you minutes not proofs. The River Lords’ crew mark you as someone who can be flattered rather than fought, and that error gives you room to slip away toward the ghost-barge while their guard is down. Later, Ulo will tell others that you owe him a consideration, and it will gnaw at the edge of any hearing you attend, but it will not bind your oath. For now, you keep the market from boiling over, you hold a key to emergencies, and you leave no public crack for rivals to wedge wider.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C3\", \"title\": \"Return the Stolen Silver to Still the Dead\", \"text\": \"You track the stolen coin through whispers and the faintest clink of guilt, hunting it like a cold spark beneath fog. You pry it loose from the eel-skin purse with the patience of a lock-keeper nursing a stubborn gate, and you cup it in your palm until the skin of your hand prickles with memory. You step into the breathless hush beside the ghost-barge and offer the coin back without flourish, naming no names and making no bargains beyond the return of what should not have been taken. You confess nothing except the city’s need to breathe without this weight, and your lantern’s lens catches the mist and plays back a sky of stars the coin does not deserve to see. You let the ferryman’s silence be your absolution and the river’s acceptance be your receipt.\", \"outcome\": \"The ferryman nods like a priest satisfied with a small rite done cleanly, and the coin’s cold leaves your skin as if a fever lifted. A child somewhere in the Undershadows will sleep through a night that would have woken them weeping, and though you may never know which child, the lanterns whisper a thanks you hear as a draft under your ear. The ghost-barge grants you a single omen-token, a dull piece of silver that warms near broken promises and will flare once like a warning bell before going cold forever. The dead debt quiets and the fog over the Flats thins, and you feel the city shift as if a knot has been loosened in a rope under strain. Your path to the ledger is clearer, and the ferryman agrees to be seen by you again before dawn should you need a witness who registers in no tally-book.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C4\", \"title\": \"Pay With Your Own Forgetting\", \"text\": \"You accept the ghost-barge coin for what it is, a scalpel you place to your own memory, and you choose a promise to cut before the blade chooses for you. You weigh your oaths and think of children saved and crews spared, and you decide that one promise to someone you love will be the tithe that keeps a greater breathing. You close your fingers and feel a chill race along your jaw and behind your ear where the scale-mark lies, and a song you hummed as a child skims off like foam on a flood. You bargain for speed rather than purity, and you ask the ferryman to smooth the way to the ledger and mute Ulo’s notice for a span of an hour. You tell yourself the bones will forgive what the fog required, and you hope that is not another promise you will forget.\", \"outcome\": \"The fog thickens for everyone but you, and in that private veil you slide through stalls and sidesteps like a fish through reeds, touching the right elbows and turning the right ropes without drawing a single accusing cough. The ferryman’s influence presses on Ulo’s stall like a hand on a drum, blurring his gaze and scattering his tally-scribes long enough for you to reach the eel-skin book and the scribe who warms it. You seize the ledger before it can be shut and feel the names shiver under your thumb as if they are trying not to be heard, and there, bright as frost, is Danka Suth and the careful initial R. Mestri. When the mist lifts, a gap opens in your mind where your brother’s voice should remind you of something you swore, and the ache of that absence bruises you with every breath. You gain the prize quickly at the cost of a personal thread, and the coin in your pouch cools to ordinary metal now that its bargain has been spent.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C5\", \"title\": \"Take the Ledger by Lantern Route\", \"text\": \"You meet Thia’s eyes and make the small, almost imperceptible sign that opens lattice and crawl to those who carry light under boards. You let the market’s thunder pass overhead as you slide beneath the western rail of the Arcade where smugglers’ chalk marks point to the crawl that breathes like a lung. You move in the hush that spore-silk masks make tighter, counting ribs and bolts until you come up under the very table where the eel-skin ledger purrs to kettle-steam. You signal a Lantern-runner to spill a cup, to draw a shout, to draw a look, and in that blink you take the ledger the way a rigger snatches a slipping line. You promise to put it back in public sight after you light it with moonshard truth, because theft is not the end but the opening of a mouth that has been clamped shut.\", \"outcome\": \"The Moth Lanterns close around you with the instinct of schooling fish, and the book is in your hands with only the scrape of eel-skin to mark its passing. A cry goes up, but it is about spilled cordial and not about missing pages, and by the time suspicion grows legs you are already in a shadowed side-deck where your moonshard paints frost over leather. The ledger murmurs when warmed and then sings when chilled, and names rise in tiny swells of ink, Danka Suth among them with the neat tail of an R. Mestri penciled like a whisper of guilt. Word of a brazen theft spreads, and the Rafter Guild snarls that you have chosen sides, but Thia’s lantern-signals counter with a theater of charity that keeps knives sheathed. You walk away with proof and with the Lanterns’ quiet gratitude, though the Vigil will expect an accounting once the book sees daylight and you will have to explain method as well as result.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"M6-C6\", \"title\": \"Lawful Seizure with Witness and Bone-Light\", \"text\": \"You draw Iven forward and call for a Vigil warden, asking for Spinegate words in a place that usually prefers river-law, and you risk turning the fair into a court. You explain that the ledger will be seized not as property but as a vessel of evidence, and you name the Oathwater and the Breath Gong as your future audience. You have Iven recite what he saw while your lantern shines on the eel-skin, the cold light making the murmuring script prickle like gooseflesh on a liar’s neck. You call for a River Lords scribe to observe, not to approve, and you speak slowly enough that no one can call it a raid, only a formal lifting. You bind yourself in words to return the book once copied in the Archive’s cold and blow the dust of ritual across the moment so that only a fool would deny the seriousness of the air.\", \"outcome\": \"The Vigil’s presence makes Ulo’s smile falter, but law gives him a stage to strut and he uses it, demanding signatures and seals until the audience grows bored enough to accept the seizure as theater. The ledger passes into your hands under the eyes of the watch and a dozen merchants, and the moment is preserved by memory as much as by ink, which was part of your aim. Iven’s testimony is taken down, and he earns a knotpass you press upon him later, which takes the sting out of his trembling when he realizes he stood against his own trade. The River Lords invoke Vaelor’s Silence to stall any immediate penalty and to bleed your momentum by a month, but the attempt backfires in the court of rumor where stalling smells like guilt. You gain legitimacy and the proof you sought, though at the cost of hardening the lines between guild and ward, and you will need a second bridge soon to keep the city from choosing an easy fracture over a difficult healing.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M5\"], \"next\": [\"M7\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Eel-skin ledger listing bribe disbursements tied to Danka Suth and ‘R.
