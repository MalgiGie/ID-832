To Scale-born ears it is a smear of tone, a three-note tremor braided beneath the usual drone that makes lantern glass tick and shiver as if teeth chattered out of season. Riggers crossing the training ledges pause and touch two fingers to the ribs, making the old sign meant for children and funerals, and even the razorkites draft higher as though the air itself were uneasy. Aerin feels Vaelor’s bones through the soles of her cliff boots, humming tight as a bowstring strung to breaking, and old grief rises with the memory of cables scored and friends lost to the long fall. After the Chainhouse deaths and whispers that the Breathkeepers withheld an omen to curry favor with the River Lords, even a hesitant note could be the blade-edge that begins a political avalanche. Ysil Aer stands by the mouth of a great pipe that exhales like a sleeping beast under winter blankets, his robe-cords tugging in the gusts, his eyes steady as oathstone. He asks Aerin to climb, to put her ear, hands, and oath to the cliff and gather the wind’s voice with the Rite-Striker’s chime, then to match those caught tones against the temple’s sealed horn-logs before breath becomes rumor. Between fear of stirring panic and fear of waiting too long, the city hangs like a lantern between ribs in a rising gale. What stirs may be mere storm-birth trapped in the cliff’s chambers, or it may be sabotage threaded through cord and bone, or it may be an older stirring in the hollow where legends say a heart still turns warm before flood. Aerin must climb where the wind slaps like an unseen hand, where ropes sing judgment, and where courage counts time in breaths, to find whether the wrong note is an omen, a crime, or the first syllable of a very old name.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Calibrate three organ mouths on the Gale Organ Cliffs using the Rite-Striker to capture their tones, braving the wind-slaps and the narrow training ledges without altering the pipes.\",\n        \"Ascend to the Aeric Aerie and retrieve last week’s sealed horn-logs under proper rite, ensuring the wax-sigils remain unbroken and documented.\",\n        \"Consult Cantor Roa Mestri privately about a missing set of wind-tones and record any details or suspicions without drawing public attention.\",\n        \"Record the anomalous three-note pattern into the Moonshard Lantern so its cold lens remembers the braid of sound for comparison in the Archive.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Ysil Aer\", \"lines\": \"The cliff sings what the city refuses to say, and it sings to those who will stop and be small enough to hear. Do you hear it, child of the hollow, three notes braided under the ordinary breath like a pulse that has learned patience? We will be accused of withholding omens again if we act on a whisper, and there are those who would make any whisper a cudgel to beat the Temple down. Yet if we wait for thunder and proof that bruises the eye, the thunder may be falling men and the proof a widow’s breath. Go with the Rite-Striker and the humility we swore, and do not strike a horn unless the wind itself begs you to. Bring me the wind’s memory, not rumor, and bring me the shape of its silence where it does not sing. If you must choose between being called a fool and letting a child go unwarned, be my fool and I will be yours at Spinegate.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aerin Rell\", \"lines\": \"I hear it, High Cantor, and it scratches the mind the way glass scratches rope, slowly and certain if left unattended. It catches like grit in a line, and I have learned the cost of letting grit stay under tension. I will find whether the false note is storm-born, organ-born, or laid there by a hand that thought itself clever and hidden. I will climb with my oath in my teeth, and I will bring back tones and the truth they point to so that no one need trust only my word. I remember the day I broke the horn-law to save children, and I remember the faces of those who forgave me afterward, and I will not spend their grace lightly. Razorkites or rumor will not turn me; bone-song and lantern-light will guide me, and if the wind names a culprit, I will hear the name in the chord.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Roa Mestri\", \"lines\": \"We sealed the horn-logs after Gale Tuning, as law demands, and I traced every wax circle with my own thumbnail until it stung, but the duplicate set we keep for audit has gone astray. It is not so grave, I tell myself, because the originals still sit under seal, but my sleep goes thin and pale when wind nudges the shutters. If someone is playing the organs through the bone by way of the locked tube, then the wrong note might be a right one forced to carry a lie, and that thought sickens me as a storm-sick pilot. Forgive me, I speak what sounds like folly when said aloud, but the Aerie shelf has felt different beneath my feet, a faint trembling like the after-voice of a bell. Be careful on the Aerie shelf, because the wind slaps have been strange and the gusts come sideways where they never did, and carry the Moonshard Lantern low so it reads the shadow of the tone as much as the light. If you find the missing copy, say nothing in the open; bring it to me in a whisper and I will answer with a rite.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aerin Rell\", \"lines\": \"Folly or warning, cantor, I will test it against the hollow and accept the answer without flinching. If a hand meddles with the city’s breath I will feel it through the bones, because the bones have taught me for twenty-seven years what honest song feels like. I will keep your confidence, and I will keep the wind’s confidence too, because I know how quickly a tone becomes a weapon when tongues grow hungry. The Moonshard Lantern will drink the braid of the three-note pattern, and the Rite-Striker will count the pulses so there can be no quarrel with what we bring back. If the Aerie shelf trembles, I will place my palm to it and remember every name cut into chime during Spine Remembering, because the dead are not merely gone, they are lessons we owe attention. When I return, may our proofs be too plain to twist and our humility too stubborn to be mocked.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Scale the pipes alone at dusk, trusting only oath, rope, and Scale-born hearing.\", \"text\": \"You coil your rigger’s line and choose dusk when razorkites turn to roost and the training ledges empty to evening kettles. Alone, each gust becomes personal and every footfall a promise to no one but yourself and the bones that hold you. You lay the Rite-Striker against the first pipe’s rim and feel the vibration in your teeth before you hear it, letting the chime kiss the metal with the smallest possible sound. The Moonshard Lantern drinks the three-note braid without witness, and the murmur of your own breath seems to stand apart as if reluctant to join what the cliff is speaking. In the half-light you find a grease-slick fingerprint where none should be, perched exactly where a saboteur would brace a knee, and you memorize its placement by the rhythm of a distant flag snap. You move on with silence as shield and humility as guide, finishing your calibration under a rising starfield that feels like an audience of unblinking eyes.\", \"outcome\": \"Your recordings come back clean and uncontested, the dusk quiet lending a clarity that makes the anomalous chord stand out like a notch in a taut rope. You twist your knee avoiding a sudden wind slap and carry a bruise as a private tithe, but no one else is risked by your choice, and no rumor grows from a crowd left out. The fingerprint you found suggests recent human tampering, and the trace of salt-ash mixed with lamp grease clings to your glove long enough to be tested in the Archive. Gor Relk cannot claim you used guild gear or endanger his crew since you climbed without them, which blunts one angle of the coming arguments. The Breathkeepers value the purity of your method and mark it as humble service, which strengthens your standing with Ysil Aer for the hearings to come. Yet in the quiet you also hear a softer undertone, a fourth note that feels like a heartbeat too slow to be mere wind, and it follows you back like a question that insists on being asked again.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Recruit a small mixed crew: one Rafter rigger and one Lantern-crawler, and climb under witnessed procedure.\", \"text\": \"You find a veteran rigger with hands like knots and a Lantern-crawler who knows the lattice under the market by touch, and you swear them both to a simple, clean purpose under the Rite. Together you speak each step aloud like a litany so the wind cannot hide your errors, and the witnesses become anchors that keep bias from pulling you sideways. The rigger checks every knot you make and you check every knot they make in turn, the quiet rivalry becoming a safety net stitched from professional pride. The Lantern-crawler points out a crawlspace beneath an organ mouth no chart marks, and their lamp-blink signals keep a discreet curtain between your work and a curious crowd. When the first gust slaps at the Aerie shelf, the rigger’s palm steadies your shoulder, and a moment later your Oathplate Shield steadies theirs, and between you a rhythm of mutual rescue begins. The Moonshard Lantern records while three sets of eyes watch for trickery, and your notes are taken on bone-etched slate in script all three can read later without dispute.\", \"outcome\": \"Your recordings are precise and your process beyond reproach, and even the Vigil clerk who observes at a distance must admit the procedure would pass a Spinegate audit. Gor Relk’s rigger goes back to the Chainhouse speaking grudging respect, and the guild anger toward you cools by a degree that matters in the days to come. The Lantern-crawler passes a quiet word to Thia Mol that you kept her folk safe and paid fair, and a new whisper replaces an old slander about the Breathkeepers hiding the poor in their rites. However, a River Lords tally-scribe notices the cluster of bodies on the cliff and spins it into talk of staged panic, so you must spend hours later answering leading questions with patient truth. The mixed crew finds a moth-wing mark etched beneath a catwalk lip exactly as you once reported, which validates your earlier claims about the sabotage and shifts suspicion away from the Lanterns. You also discover that the anomalous three-note chord strengthens when the rigger’s counterweight drum turns, suggesting a resonance between the Chainhouse system and the cliff organs that someone might exploit.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Invoke audit authority and move through Spinegate first, securing writs before touching a single rope.\", \"text\": \"You descend into Spinegate Hall where whispers carry to a stone meant to shame liars, and you request an audit writ with the patience of someone who knows that haste can break truth. The Vigil clerk makes you read aloud the clause that permits emergency calibration during inquiry, and you do so without embellishment, because clean words cut through fog. You wait as the Triune’s adjutants bicker in the corridor, and you let their noise wash over you like a gale that you have been trained to lean into without anger. When the writ comes, stamped wet and shining, you feel the weight of law settle about you like a second harness and decide you will carry both or neither. You show the writ to every gatekeeper between the Temple and the Cliffs, and you keep copies of their names and the time a bell chimed near each, because dates are the ribs of testimony. You approach the Aeric Aerie with papers in hand and patience in your breath, and every step becomes a public argument made in calm ink rather than heated voice.\", \"outcome\": \"The writ makes later disputes dissolve like mist under noon, because cruel tongues cannot so easily claim you trespassed where you should not have walked. Your upward climb is slowed by the pageantry of signatures and the ritual of seals, but the Moonshard Lantern still drinks the three-note braid before the wind shifts and your timing remains sound. High Cantor Ysil Aer publicly praises your insistence on lawful rites, and the Vigil notes your cooperation in their ledger with a token that eases future crossings at night. The River Lords’ gossip machine tries to spin your paperwork into proof of guilt seeking cover, but the presence of the Oathwater Basin’s keeper at the initial stamping undercuts that angle. You find that one horn-log seal bears a fingernail burr that is not your own, proof that someone handled the wax after consecration, and the Spinegate scribe quietly pockets a copy of your note about it for later leverage. The law’s slow pace costs you nothing essential today, and it gains you a trail of names that may matter when the wrong note demands a voice in council.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Slip through the locked bone-song tube at night to feel the organ’s voice from within the cliff.\", \"text\": \"You wait for the lanterns along the ribwalk to thin into private constellations, and you move like a coal under ash toward the Temple’s secret tube that carries bone-song into the Aerie. The lock’s hiss is not disobedience but an older permission, because you carry the Breathkeepers’ token and a paladin’s oath that knows when rules are fences and when they are walls. Within, the stone is cool and the sound is not heard so much as worn like a garment, and you feel where the three notes scrape at your bones as if asking to be let out. You place the Moonshard Lantern in the tube’s throat and let it see the sound the way a shard remembers stars, and for a long breathing you do not name anything for fear of naming it wrong. You press your palm to the living cold and count with the Rite-Striker in your other hand, heart synced to wind until you no longer know which drum is which. When you emerge onto the Aerie shelf you are wind-stung and salt-tasted, and the city below seems very far and very loved, and you are ready to climb the outer face with a certainty that feels borrowed from something older than you.\", \"outcome\": \"Your recordings carry nuances no outside climb could have caught, faint sub-tones that show where the cliff swallows and where it speaks in the same instant. The secret path leaves no public footprint, which keeps saboteurs from learning what you know, but it also gives the suspicious space to claim you invented what you bring back if you do not prepare corroboration. High Cantor Ysil Aer reads your face and hears the echo in your voice and believes you without needing any other seal, which is both a comfort and a responsibility you feel in your wrists. You discover a place where the bone-song lingers as if a hand once pressed there too often, and the residue is not temple-sweet wax but market pitch, suggesting someone with commerce on their fingers has been near. The taste of the three-note chord is not only mechanical; it carries a warmth at the edge of perception, the sort of warmth Breathkeeper doctrine names when it speaks of Elderbarrow’s heart, and the thought both steadies and unsettles you. In the days that follow, whispers arise that you walked in places others call forbidden, but your results are so rich that even your critics must argue the interpretation rather than the existence of what you found.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [], \"next\": [\"M2\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Sanction\", \"description\": \"Breathkeeper Rite-sanction granting legal use of the Rite-Striker outside formal rite for this specific inquiry, recognized by the Vigil and respected by the Temple.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Access\", \"description\": \"Access token to the Aeric Aerie shelf during winds of safe strength, permitting entry without escort when duty calls and conditions allow.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Reputation\", \"description\": \"Favorable standing with the Breathkeepers of the Unbroken Breath, reflected in public commendation and private trust during future storm-watch deliberations.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
