Sera Dake’s summons came stamped hot from the Foundry, the wax still smelling of salt-ash and wind, and the words within named a fear that set the bones of the city humming in Aerin’s inner ear. Kessa Tharn, the Conclave’s keenest inspector, had vanished after flagging a forged maintenance certification that, if honored, would send weight through a rib in a way the Hollow Oath forbids, like driving a nail into sacred grain. The Lantern-signal that marked the trail—three soft pulses and a moth-wing flicker—drew Aerin down-rope into the Ossuary Gardens, past spore-silk curtains, along ladders glazed in drip, and into a world of pale bioluminescence where the air tasted of mushrooms and old rain. There, the beds remembered the city’s footsteps with a slow crackle, the mycelium whispering the passings of riggers, smugglers, and frightened runners, and the pale caps bent like listening ears. Under a sweep of lace fungus, tucked as if a desperate hand had tried to return her to the earth and let the soil breathe her back, lay Kessa Tharn, broken but breathing, her pulse stubborn, her eyelids fluttering to the rhythm of the wind through the organ cliffs above. A rafter’s knot bit into her wrist, a professional loop too neat for common thugs, and brine grit packed the seam of her boots, tasting of Riverfoot’s slick planks and the Saltlick’s whipped spray, telling of a struggle that crossed terrace and chainwalk both. In the hush between spore drips, Kessa’s voice rasped of resonant tiles stolen from the Foundry test-walls, of a sharp song meant for bracing twisted into a knife meant for shattering, and of a name spoken in anger and fear: Danka Suth, a Rafter foreman whose hands were everywhere a cable hummed. And there, slick with specks of salt and fungus dust, lay a purse stamped with the eel-skin sigil of the River Lords, an oily boast of coin, power, and the river’s cold current tugging at the city’s ribs. The mission turns on care and witness: follow the Lantern-Queen’s cautious glow, stabilize Kessa’s breath without trading her spine for haste, gather the physical proof that matches the song in the bones, and carry word to the Vigil and Sera Dake before the city’s enemies can choreograph a different ending.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Descend to the Ossuary Gardens using safe ropes and a spore mask, following Thia Mol’s lantern-signal and keeping within sanctioned ladders and anchor points so that no fungal bed is crushed and no taboo rung is taken for speed.\",\n        \"Locate and stabilize Kessa Tharn with calm hands and measured breath; extract her testimony without moving her overly much by cooling her brow, splinting what must be braced, and listening until her story is complete enough to withstand guild knives.\",\n        \"Gather the physical clues that truth can wear in court: the rafter’s knot looped on her wrist, the brine grit wedged in her boot-seams, and the purse stamped with the eel-skin sigil of the River Lords, each bagged and sealed in sight of witnesses.\",\n        \"Secure Kessa’s passage to Vigil care by litter and careful climbers, and alert Sera Dake of the resonant tile diversion at once, invoking the Conclave’s inspection writ to protect the scene and to freeze any attempt to line plates along a forbidden curve.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sera Dake\", \"lines\": \"Our oath forbids cuts to bone, yet it also bids us lay our palms upon the ribs when they shiver and name aloud the danger in their tremor. Fear sits in my chest like a weight tonight, and it is an honest fear because it smells of salt-ash and ink scraped thin to hide a false seal. An inspector of mine named something that smelled like both salt and smoke, and then she disappeared between one bell and the next, which means someone thinks panic can erase a line etched in bone. Find her, Aerin, not only because I ask as Conclave, but because the ribs themselves seem to hum a note of warning and you were born to hear that hidden tone. If Conclave hands are dirty, I will clean them in public on the high ribs and risk the scorn of every guild, but I will not let a rival write the story first nor let the River Lords wash the blood scent from eel-skin with a ledger and a grin.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Aerin Rell\", \"lines\": \"I’ll bring her back or bring what she tried to say with care enough that no one can sand it down to a polite lie. If resonant tiles were taken, then someone wants the bones to sing wrong, and a wrong song in Vaelor’s frame is a blade you only hear an instant before it bites. I can hear the edges of that song already, a cruel overtone hiding under the wind, and it makes the oathstone in my shield grow uncomfortably warm against my palm. I will walk the ladders and keep to the anchor points, and I will borrow every quiet eye in the Undershadows to see who scuffed brine onto terrace boards. When the truth is gathered, I will set it before the Vigil and your Conclave in the open light, and if any hand reaches to tilt the scale, I will slam my shield’s edge across their knuckles and remind them what the Hollow Oath demands.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Kessa Tharn\", \"lines\": \"Don’t let them line the plates along a curve, not there, not where the rib has a memory of strain; it turns the hum into a knife that carves the very silence we trust to hold. It felt clever in the test-wall until the wind shifted and the cracks answered like teeth chattering, and I begged to halt trials until we learned more. Sera thought we could use resonance to brace, and we can in straight spans and with honest tone, but the requisition I traced bent it toward harm, because the purchase order asked for curvature that no sane brace would demand. I traced the requisition to Danka Suth, and when I went to ask questions, he smiled like a rigger proud of a perfect splice and my stomach went cold because I saw Riverfoot grit on his boot and eel-skin shine in his purse. A purse with eel-skin silver paid for a quiet stamp sat warm in his pocket, so I tried to tear the page and run, but they tied me like a bundle with a rafter’s knot I’d admire on any other day and kicked me into the fungus to let the beds remember me as a lost footstep rather than a living voice.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Mira Olt\", \"lines\": \"Spore-light will hide her while we fetch a litter, and the beds here are old friends that know how to cradle what must be kept still without smothering breath.

Go, paladin, take the path of small lights and soft boots, and I will guard the woman’s spine with the same care I use with my own mother’s bones. The rafter knots on her skin smell like the Chainhouse at shift-change, and the brine in her boot seams tastes of the lower locks where eel-skin coins are counted in shadow.

We’ve seen eel-skin shine in places it shouldn’t, and we’ve heard cable-song turn sour where happy work once sang, and that tells me a money-hand wants the city to dance on a frayed cord. Follow me quiet, paladin, and I’ll put eyes on the catwalks and ears in the lattice, and if a rafter foreman thinks he can tie his sin into a neat bow, we’ll tug the right thread and let it unravel in his own hands. You know I’m not fond of the Conclave’s temper, but I’m less fond still of bones cracked for coin, so I’ll risk a favor and trust your oath to keep our little ones from being ground into toll-dust. When the time comes, signal me with your moonshard’s soft hum, and I’ll turn the lantern once for truth, twice for danger, and three times if we need to vanish like smoke before a gale.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Carry Kessa openly to the Vigil and announce a public inquiry\", \"text\": \"I will climb with deliberate grace, call a Vigil litter to the Ossuary mouth, and bear Kessa through the ribwalks where everyone can see the careful hands that lift her. The law will be a lantern higher than mine tonight, and I will let its light wash over every witness, so not even a guildmaster can claim ignorance when the bells ring. I will present the rafter’s knot, the brine grit, and the eel-skin purse one by one in Spinegate Hall, and I will speak each item’s story aloud until it takes on its own spine and can stand without me. I will ask Sera Dake to sit present, Jarik Rell to mark the chain of custody, and the Breathkeepers to toll the soft warning note that freezes all nonessential work on suspect spans. I know this will warn Danka Suth and any River Lord who paid in eel-skin that the hunt is on, but I judge that a frightened criminal leaves deeper prints than a calm one, and the city deserves a show of open oathkeeping.\", \"outcome\": \"The public procession draws a hush along the ribwalks and a murmur along the Crown-Market, and by the time you reach Spinegate Hall, the Seat of the Hollow seems to listen. The Vigil takes Kessa into careful keeping, and Jarik Rell’s quill scratches like a metronome as he signs off on each sealed pouch you deliver. Sera Dake meets your gaze without flinching and agrees aloud to halt all resonant experiments pending inquiry, which buys you favor with the ordinary craftfolk who fear accidents more than politics. The Rafter Guild roils like a net full of hooked fish, and Gor Relk snarls about theater even as he cannot refuse a joint safety audit under the Vigil’s eye, so Danka Suth slips from his berth and vanishes into a tangle of crew houses.

We will thread the Undershadows and pass beneath the Crown-Market in the smugglers’ crawl, and there we will whisper a decoy rumor about a cache of resonant tiles being ferried the wrong way up the Chainhouse. I will post two Lantern runners where the catwalks meet the brake drums, and I will take station where I can hear the wind-organ’s smallest change, because sabotage has its own rhythm and I have learned to dance opposite it. When Danka Suth or his knife-hands come to nibble what they think is illicit bait, I will cut their retreat with my hook and let the Lanterns flood them in quiet light while I speak the Hollow Oath to still their more reckless urges. Only after the trap’s jaws have closed will I summon the Vigil, and in that narrow silence between crime and consequence I will ask just one question in a voice that feels like a taut rope: who paid for the eel-skin purse.\", \"outcome\": \"The decoy rumor sparkles through the Undershadows like a thrown coin and lands exactly where you hoped, drawing two of Danka’s crew to probe the Chainhouse’s shadowed catwalk at the change of shift. Thia’s lanterns blossom in a ring without a shout, the kind of light that feels more like memory than exposure, and your hook slips neat as a prayer through a retreat line to make the smallest of sounds that breaks the biggest of hearts. The knife-hands freeze when you murmur the oath and touch shield to steel, and in that held breath one of them glances toward Riverfoot without meaning to, which is the truism of guilt in a city strung on cables. The Vigil arrives to the quiet aftermath and hauls the two away, and Jarik’s first question is a glare meant as much for you as for them, but he cannot argue with the ledger chit and the eel-skin stamp you place in his palm. Danka Suth does not appear, yet word leaks that he sent them under orders to ‘inspect’ the wrong hour, and Sera Dake, though uneasy about your shadowed route, grants you latitude in exchange for your promise to bring all further evidence into the open without Lantern filters.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Confront Danka Suth at the Chainhouse Triad under the Conclave writ\", \"text\": \"I will march to the Triad with the wind at my back and the inspection writ held where the brake smoke can stain it honest, and I will read it aloud so even the winch drums must listen.

Then I will lay the rafter’s knot on the bench, spill brine grit onto the obsidian step, and set the eel-skin purse down like a tamed serpent, and I will ask Danka Suth to explain in simple words that do not slide off the ear. If he blusters, I will let the silence after each lie grow heavy enough that the drums feel slower, and I will use the oathstone’s warmth to pace my questions the way a pilot paces water. When he looks past me for help, I will make sure he sees his crews’ faces watching, because a foreman hates disappointing the eyes that trust his knots more than he fears any guild fine.\", \"outcome\": \"The Triad’s platforms shudder to a halt under the Vigil’s temporary sanction, and the echoing clatter dies into a hush that leaves only the drip of cooling lines and the distant five-note sigh of the organ cliffs. Gor Relk bristles like a cat in rain at the interruption, but the writ’s seal and your implacable stance pry a warning concession from him; he allows a walk-through on specific plates while his crews ring the rails and watch. Danka Suth tries three smiles and two alibis, each thinner than the last, and when you set the eel-skin purse between you, his gaze flickers as if a sudden gust pricked his eyes; your oathstone warms enough to sting, and half the watching riggers shift on their feet. He invokes a ‘temporary repair’ and claims the brine is from a night run to Riverfoot, but a younger rigger coughs out that the timing is wrong and that repairs were cut short for a private meeting, which snaps a cable in the room that no hand can re-splice. The Vigil steps in to escort Danka for formal inquiry, Sera Dake orders resonant tiles locked under double seal, and while the River Lords bluster about slander, three toll clerks begin to ask careful questions among themselves, knowing the lesson of wind and web: when one line goes taut, another line reveals who pulled.\"\n      ]},\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M3\"], \"next\": [\"M5\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Writ\", \"description\": \"Conclave inspection writ bearing Sera Dake’s seal, allowing site access during structural emergencies and granting the authority to halt unsafe work on spans under immediate suspicion.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Consumable\", \"description\": \"A pouch of antibiotic shelf fungus poultice from the Ossuary keepers, enough for several careful dressings to cool fever and fight rot without stinging the spirit.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Faction Pledge\", \"description\": \"Public pledge from Sera Dake to submit Conclave experiments—resonant tiles included—to Vigil oversight, with audit logs posted at Spinegate for a lunar month.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
