      "description": "At the Gale Organ Cliffs, the wind runs wrong and the gorge seems to listen back. To Scale-born ears it is a smear of tone, a three-note tremor braided beneath the usual drone that makes lantern glass tick and shiver as if teeth chattered out of season. Riggers crossing the training ledges pause and touch two fingers to the ribs, making the old sign meant for children and funerals, and even the razorkites draft higher as though the air itself were uneasy. Aerin feels Vaelor’s bones through the soles of her cliff boots, humming tight as a bowstring strung to breaking, and old grief rises with the memory of cables scored and friends lost to the long fall. After the Chainhouse deaths and whispers that the Breathkeepers withheld an omen to curry favor with the River Lords, even a hesitant note could be the blade-edge that begins a political avalanche. Ysil Aer stands by the mouth of a great pipe that exhales like a sleeping beast under winter blankets, his robe-cords tugging in the gusts, his eyes steady as oathstone. He asks Aerin to climb, to put her ear, hands, and oath to the cliff and gather the wind’s voice with the Rite-Striker’s chime, then to match those caught tones against the temple’s sealed horn-logs before breath becomes rumor. Between fear of stirring panic and fear of waiting too long, the city hangs like a lantern between ribs in a rising gale. What stirs may be mere storm-birth trapped in the cliff’s chambers, or it may be sabotage threaded through cord and bone, or it may be an older stirring in the hollow where legends say a heart still turns warm before flood. Aerin must climb where the wind slaps like an unseen hand, where ropes sing judgment, and where courage counts time in breaths, to find whether the wrong note is an omen, a crime, or the first syllable of a very old name.",
