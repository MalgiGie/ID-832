      "description": "Dawn climbs the Galecliffs with a breath like cool iron, and Ribcrown wakes threaded in color and sound. Banners bite the wind between ribs, bells kiss and ring, and the ribs themselves hum a faint expectation that presses against the teeth when one smiles. On the Crown-Market Arcade, counterweights hang like sleeping moons while tally-scribes drag chalk across slate and River Lords whisper over ledgers bright with eel-skin sheen. In the Foundry-Kilns, Bonewrights lay work-rough hands on pale plates and murmur to the bones, promising steadiness if steadiness is asked of them. The Temple’s horns glint along the Gale Organ Cliffs, and Breathkeepers in storm-blue bind their hair and set their hands to reeds and tone-cords, listening for the river’s far-off temper as if for a child’s cough in a crowded room. Aerin Rell moves between all of it as if her feet know every plank by memory and every rope by name, a paladin carrying the hush before a thunderclap; the moonshard lantern at her hip answers the organ caves with a faint, kind hum. Ulo Hen stands at the market’s edge with a smile too still to be safe, and his hireblades stand like polite shadows that forgot how to blink. Danka Suth keeps to a tug-line gallery above the Chainhouse Triad with grease on his knuckles and a lever’s bite already weeping against his palm, shame wrapped in stubbornness like wire in pitch. When the sky is clean and the organ should sing only a bright weaving of festival notes, a five-note descent slides through the stone like a wet knife, and every trained ear in Ribcrown turns toward it with the same thought: this is the storm’s voice, but there is no storm. The tilt ready to be blamed on physics is a human plan with a counterfeit wind for its herald, a resonance engineered like a trap’s jaw. Sorn’s wardens are spread thin as oaths stretched on too many hooks, and the Vigil’s lamplighters run hot-footed along the ribs with the edict rolled under an arm and fear tucked under the tongue. Thia’s lanterns pass quick signals in the lattice, little pulses of meaning that wink across shingles and bone as if moths carry law instead of light. Gor Relk’s crews knot their lines and anchor boots, and Sera Dake’s Bonewrights stand before their plates ready to smash their own craft rather than let it turn murderous. High Cantor Ysil Aer listens, chin lifted to the wind as if smelling rain, and makes a sign over the Breath Gong that is not yet rung. The city inhales together, and Aerin hears the serpent’s hollow carry both the lie and the cure. Tonight the city will sing, but only if its hearts agree to breathe as one.",
      "objectives": [
        "Coordinate with the Breathkeepers at the Gale Organ Cliffs and call a deliberate counter-tone that unknots the forged resonance laid to tilt the Crown-Market, canceling the curve without cracking nerves.",
        "Lead mixed teams from the Vigil and the Moth Lanterns through lattice and catwalk to reach the Crown-Market counterweight housings and secure every lock before the false signal is thrown.",
        "Climb to the Chainhouse tug-line galleries and confront Danka Suth at the primed lever; turn his hand from sabotage, take him alive, and seize his seals, letters, and any ciphered correspondence.",
        "Expose Ulo Hen’s orchestration in public sight using the decoded schedule, ledgers, and hireblade testimony; set the words in the air where the Triune and the market can hear, and secure his arrest without blood.",
        "Guide Ribcrown through Gale Tuning without panic by pacing announcements, holding a steady presence on the ribs, and sounding the Heart-Reed Charm where needed to settle crowds into one breath instead of many shouts."
      ],
      "dialogue": [
        { "speaker": "Sorn Ilt", "lines": "Listen close, all of you, because the city cannot afford a second telling while the wind plays tricks. The Triune has signed the emergency edict and put it in my keeping, and I am putting it in yours, Aerin, because the ribs listen when you walk them. We are spread so thin a stiff word might cut us, and every faction thinks their problem is the only fire worth water. You will make your moves clean, you will name your intentions before you act, and you will keep your people’s hands low unless blood spills. If we do this right, the only thing the market remembers is a song that steadied their feet, a lever that never moved, and a warden who took a smile off a merchant’s face without breaking his jaw. I will be the ugly voice at Spinegate if things turn, but I would rather be the echo of your calm than the bell after the fall." },
        { "speaker": "Thia Mol", "lines": "Lanterns, hear me and hold your blades like secrets you do not wish to tell. Today we are chorus, not dagger, and a chorus holds a city on the breath between notes when fear would make fools of everyone. Blink the rooftop code so clean a lamplighter could copy it blind, and keep the crawls open for Vigil boots whether they say thank you or not. If someone comes for us with iron in their eyes, we will defend our own, but not before the counterweights are locked, not before the children on the Arcade feel the deck stand still under them. Aerin has risked more for us than most who wear crests, and today we risk for the city by making sure no one has to see what we are capable of in the dark. When the five-note lie tries to own the air, we answer with lantern-light and quiet hands and leave no purchase for panic to climb." },
        { "speaker": "Gor Relk", "lines": "Danka, I have buried men for less than the shadow you cast on my crews, but I have also fed the widows of fools who didn’t know how to quit a bad plan. You bleed Guild blood and you were made by ropes that sing when the wind strikes them, so do not stain that with coin someone tossed you like offal. Drop the lever, look me in the eye, and tell me who met you under the brake drums and taught you the cuts; I can smell the foreign pitch from here. Three riggers died because someone made a mark shaped like a moth and hoped I’d light the city on fire to cook the truth, and I will not be their fourth mistake. You know how many hands it takes to keep one platform true in a crosswind, so imagine how many it takes to hold a city steady; do not make us use all of them to pry your fingers loose. If you make me drag you, I will, and I will keep you alive because the Vigil asked it and because I want you to hear the names at Spine Remembering with your own ears." },
        { "speaker": "Ulo Hen", "lines": "This is not the place for theater, Paladin, and certainly not the time to make trade into a mask you can point at and call a villain. Trade is breath, and the market is the lung that keeps this cliff from sleeping, and you do not arrest breath because it frightens you when it comes fast. You stand in festival blue and speak about oaths, but the only oath that keeps children fed is the ledger’s promise to pay at dusk. You mistake mechanism for malice because you wear iron on your conscience where others wear coin, and the city should not be made to sway to one woman’s moral music. If the counterweights were to move, it would be physics and timing, and the people would learn a lesson about balance written by the wind and not by your sanctimony." },
        { "speaker": "Aerin Rell", "lines": "I was born where the lamps never went out because darkness had learned our stair, and I have breathed the bones since I was old enough to listen for the first creak before a fall. Trade is current and it turns the wheels; breath is breath and it belongs to us all, and if you have to steal air to buy a better rate, your math is murder. The Hollow Oath does not say we are above need, it says we do not cut bone, and your tricks take a saw to every trust that holds us. By the echo of the Seat and the taste of Oathwater fresh on my tongue, by the ledger you tried to drown in moonlight and the hireblade who could not stand the way his own son looked at him, I name your plan and I refuse it. Sorn, take him when the crowd can see his smile crack and know it for what it is. And if the wind tries to lie again with a fifth note sliding where none belongs, I will answer with the Heart-Reed and give the city a true chord to stand on." },
        { "speaker": "Ysil Aer", "lines": "Hear the Hollow and heed the wind, because the wind tells the truth even when men lay notes like snares inside it. A counter-tone is not a shout; it is a cupped hand around a frightened candle, it is a palm against a panicked chest counting to four and back again. We will sing in the intervals that make stone remember its patience, and we will not ring the Breath Gong unless the sky itself bares its teeth. Aerin, stand at the second mouth and let your lantern answer the cave, because the moonshard knows how to hold a starfield still when the night would smear it. We do not drown men today, not in water, not in noise, and not in the cleverness of their own schemes. Let the last note fall into relief rather than mourning, and let the people think only of how good it felt to breathe together." },
        { "speaker": "Sera Dake", "lines": "My hands have learned every way bone-ceramic can crack, from pride to haste to the wrong song in a midday heat, and I will not let my plates be made accomplices to cowardice. The Hollow Oath binds my guild to brace the hollow that holds us, and if bracing today means breaking what we made before it breaks someone’s mother, then we will break it with love and name the shards after those we spared. I have tuned these tiles to hum true with Vaelor’s quiet, and I can detune them with one strike that changes the city’s weight by less than a breath but keeps a swindle from becoming a disaster. Stand with us in a line and watch our hammers stay low unless the signal flies, because craft is patience, not panic. When the Vigil calls for the locks to bite, they will bite; and if the market tries to tilt, it will find my plates have learned to refuse the wrong dance." },
        { "speaker": "Danka Suth", "lines": "I have stood on these galleries since I had to wrap the ropes twice round my wrist to feel strong enough, and I have watched men fall who deserved a rope and not a prayer. They came to me with coin, yes, but also with names I recognized from the docks, and they spoke of my sister’s debt like it was a wind I could not tack against if I did not learn a new song. I told myself it was only a lever and physics and that Gor would shout and the market would sway and the day would end with nothing worse than a scare and a new purse. But when the organ sang the five notes in a sky that wore no cloud, I thought of the children who run the lantern-lattice like it was a game, and I felt sick to my fingers. I am not brave enough to be the villain you need me to be, and I am not clean enough to be the hero you are; take me alive if you must, and I will put names in your hand that make my stomach turn." },
        { "speaker": "Jarik Rell", "lines": "Little sister, I have known your stubbornness since you refused to be carried up the ribs and made me tie a harness you could walk with while our mother cursed and laughed through her teeth. The law is a rope that burns if you grab it too late, and you have a habit of seizing lines that are not yours because the wind has frightened you with the truth you hear. Sorn has given you the edict and that means you carry the city’s face today, so make certain the city likes what it sees when it looks in your eyes. I will post wardens where your shadow lengthens and I will take the blame if someone needs a name to throw at a wall, but I ask you to remember the promise you once made me about naming any saboteur you found. Do not let mercy become a silence that costs lives, and do not let anger make you forget why you broke a law once to save children who still remember your voice in their sleep." }
