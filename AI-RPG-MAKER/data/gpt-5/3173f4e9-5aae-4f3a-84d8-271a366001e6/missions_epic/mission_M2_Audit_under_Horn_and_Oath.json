    "description": "Spinegate Hall breathes like a great lung of bone, the ribs of the chamber carrying whispers to a central stone until even a hissed doubt rings with public weight. Bone wax sweetens the air atop the tang of wet rope and old flood, and the Oathwater Basin reflects torchlight like a dark eye beneath the empty Seat of the Hollow. The Triune’s chairs stand in severe geometry, while market-hands, riggers, and riverfolk knot the galleries with mutter, scarf, and suspicion, weaving rumor as if it were another rope to stretch across the abyss. Aerin steps in with the measure of a paladin sworn to the Unbroken Breath, her lantern humming with a low, attentive tone that answers the distant murmur of the Gale Organ Cliffs. In her hand glint the retrieved tones from the last mission’s climb, inked and notched in the paladin’s script, and already she can feel the wrongness in the rhythm of the posted horn-logs, like a skipped heartbeat that hides a bruise. Sorn Ilt, all straight lines and practical sorrow, calls her to the Oathwater as Vigil wardens sweep poles across the hall to keep tempers from clashing, and Jarik Rell’s gaze catches her like a hook as if to say he trusts her to brave the drop but not to lie about the way the wind pushes. The Breathkeepers’ cantors ring the faintest chimes, conceding the audit with the humility of people who know the weather does not bargain, yet in the set of High Cantor Ysil Aer’s shoulders, Aerin hears the weight of a rumor sharpened into a blade. The sealed logs do not match the tones; a page has been neatly resected, a copy altered in a careful hand, and inside a horn’s throat an etch shaped like a moth’s wing marks a crawlspace cut from the lattice beneath the Crown-Market Arcade where smugglers and law alike sometimes go when the city prefers not to see. What might have been a clerical tremor opens toward a fissure that could split the ribs: if the Breathkeepers lied, the River Lords will buy a verdict and sell it on the Arcade, if the Vigil overreaches, the Moth Lanterns will light the Undershadows with defiance, and if the Rafter Guild feels mocked, the Chainhouse Triad will grind to a halt and starve the heights. The audit is a knife’s walk over the Anther, and every footfall must be set where oath, proof, and mercy touch.",

            "lines": "I will not let this city be torn between horns and ledgers, not while I bear the Vigil’s charge and while my name still weighs something in this hall. We will test oaths by the water and by the wind, and we will let neither priest nor merchant buy an hour of safety with a lie. Aerin, you are both Breathkeeper-sworn and known to the Vigil, and that makes you a bridge I am asking to hold while others stampede across. Walk with me in sight of the Seat of the Hollow, and let the hall hear that we choose patience, measurement, and the old laws rather than spectacle. Tell me what the bones told you, tell me what your lantern remembered, and we will put it against the ink until any false note screams for everyone to hear."

            "speaker": "Aerin Rell",
            "lines": "The tones I drew from the cliffs hold a low triad I have only heard when the river bares its teeth and the cliffs answer from the deep pipes, and that alone is enough to set the hair rising along the ropes. The posted logs account for it in neither time nor mark, and the wax-seals carry wind-scars that skip an hour like a sailor cutting a knot he cannot untie. Someone cut a page, soldier’s neat, and left a moth-wing scratch inside the horn’s mouth where only a rigger’s grip could settle, and that is a crawl-signal from the Crown-Market lattice known to those who move unseen. I do not say the Breathkeepers lied, and I do not say the River Lords bribed, but the city sings in chords, and this chord has a missing voice and a borrowed echo. If we follow the echo into the Aeric Aerie and into the Arcade crawls, we will either pull a saboteur into daylight or clear the temple’s name in a way no faction can dispute."

            "lines": "Sister, I have walked the Undershadows with you when the spores glowed and the ropes went slick, and I know your ear better than I trust any ledger, but I need more than faith to carry a case through this storm. Gods, Aer, if you are keeping names from me—if this leads where those marks under the Chainhouse did—I need to know you will not shield anyone who treats our lives like counterweights to test a machine. The Vigil cannot chase ghosts while the Triune snarls over fees, because if we split our crews now the Arcade will riot and Riverfoot will brace for knives in fog. Tell me your step-by-step, tell me what you will ask of the crowd and what you will withhold, and let me put my badge behind it without feeling I have handed a blade to someone who will not cut. Give me something I can tell Captain Ilt that keeps the Vigil’s hands clean even if everyone else comes away smelling of pitch."

            "lines": "We consent to the audit, Captain, because the Breath does not fear being measured and because no wind has ever changed course for the sake of pride alone. The Breath will endure being doubted; it is better than the city drowning in certainty, and better than watching the people choose between a comforting lie and a hard warning. Find the missing hour, and if a cantor erred, the Breathkeepers will atone on the ribs with the straps and the song, and the song will be sung in public at Gale Tuning. If a hand outside the temple touched our horns, bring that hand here wet with Oathwater and we will help weigh it, and we will not shelter it for the sake of our name. Hear me clearly, paladin and Captain: our rites bind us to caution, but our oaths bind us to truth, and truth that saves lives is never a betrayal of the Breath."

            "text": "Aerin raises her Oathplate Shield so its oathstone gleams, asks Sorn for authority, and calls for a cross-cordon to clamp the Crown-Market lattice and the Aeric Aerie at once. She explains to the crowd in a steady cadence that sealing the crawls is not an accusation but a safety brace, like tying off a swaying deck while you check the knots, and that any who claim injury may witness each step. She promises to count wind-scars on every seal in the Oathwater’s reflection with Jarik’s tally and to read the horn-throats aloud so all can hear, and she vows that no Breathkeeper horn will be handled without a cantor’s hands present. She warns the River Lords that any attempt to move cargo through the lattice during the audit will be read as defiance of the Vigil’s lawful order, and she asks the Rafter Guild to lend two riggers as neutral witnesses so the Guild cannot claim the temple mocked them. She closes by pledging to publish the audit’s hour-marks on the Crown-Market boards before dusk so rumor cannot make mischief in the unmarked spaces.",
            "outcome": "The cordon slams into place with the crisp clack of wardens’ poles and the flutter of Vigil flags, and the crowd, denied motion, settles into a restless, quivering patience. In the Aeric Aerie, the horn-tubes bloom under lantern light like pale throats, and the moth-wing etch is copied onto oath vellum with rigger witnesses counting each scratch while a Breathkeeper tends the tones. The missing page’s hour reveals itself by the subtle rhythm of wind-scar spacing, and the public counting makes the absence undeniable even to those who came to scoff; the hall hears the number and murmurs it back as if it were a prayer. The River Lords fume but do not contest the cordon when Jarik reads the statute that grants cross-cordon rights during storm-risk inquiry, and the Rafter Guild grudgingly acknowledges that the process honors safety law, though Gor Relk speaks through his teeth. When the seals are restored, the city’s heat has lowered a notch, the Vigil’s authority stands steadier, and a clear trail of marks leads from the horn to a lattice crawl that the Lanterns favor, forcing the next step without letting tempers snap a cable."

            "text": "Aerin counsels patience and whispers at the Oathwater’s edge that a public seal will spook the shadow-hand into molt, but a watch could let it fly into her net. She proposes to Ysil Aer and Sorn Ilt that the altered copy remain posted and that the missing page’s hour be left unannounced for one night while Vigil lamplighters and Lantern sympathizers watch the Crown-Market crawls from opposite ends. She explains that the Scale-born ear can hear the faint fatigue in a horn’s throat when it is touched and that her lantern can replay the starfield around the Aerie, catching the silhouette of any who works in darkness, and she pledges to stand alone in the Aerie all night if need be. She argues that a caught hand gives the Breathkeepers more than exoneration; it gives them a penitent, and that a penitent gives the city a story to trust, which matters more than any ledger. She assures Jarik she will mark every step in a Vigil ledger and that if the bait fails, the next dawn will still accept a lawful cordon without making the Vigil look like it panicked into power.",
            "outcome": "Sorn weighs prudence against spectacle and nods, and High Cantor Ysil Aer blesses the stillness of the plan with a low hum that marries the hall’s bones to the night’s breath. Lamplighters take stations along the lattice with their flames capped, and a single Moth Lantern sigil blinks once from the undereave in acknowledgement of a truce born of mutual need, not soft hearts. Midnight drags a cold finger over the Aerie, and Aerin hears the horn’s skin sing twice like a plucked thread as someone tests the mouth in the dark; her moonshard lens blooms with remembered stars and stains the intruder’s outline in pale frost. The shadow-hand is deft, not a temple cantor by stance but someone comfortable with rope sway, and when Jarik moves the lamplighters in, the capture is a clean drop of net rather than a riot. The caught saboteur carries a River Lords tally-scrip and a moth-wing etching stone, and the hall wakes to a confession under Oathwater that shifts blame away from the Breathkeepers without absolving anyone of plots woven between profit and pride."

            "title": "Invoke shared humility: a public rite of tones and oaths before the Seat of the Hollow",
            "text": "Aerin steps into the center and requests, with a bow to the empty Seat of the Hollow, that all factions submit to a mutual binding: a rite of tones where each chair of the Triune names their hour and places a hand in the basin. She speaks of the Gale Tuning and of how the city sings only when each chord accepts its part, and she asks the Breathkeepers to call the low triad again so the hall may hear the difference between omen and forgery. She asks the River Lords to suspend their toll for one river-bell as proof that trade does not die when pride kneels, and she asks the Rafter Guild to lower a counterweight into the hall to show they can bear what they demand others to bear. She tells the crowd that in a city of ribs, humility is not surrender but alignment, and that only aligned ribs hold an arch, and she binds her own palm to Oathwater first so that if there is a lie in the room, the oathstone in her shield will burn her as example. She promises that once the rite is done, she will walk the Aeric Aerie with Ysil Aer and Jarik Rell together, and that any name found in that walk will be spoken by all three, not one.",
            "outcome": "The rite stills the hall like the pause before a gale when every rope goes taut and waits, and the echo ribs carry the three named hours back and forth until the crowd begins to hear the gap for themselves. The Breathkeepers sound the low triad, and its true weight presses tears from old pilots who remember standing on broken decks, while the copied log’s triad feels thin, all ink and no wind. River Lords grumble and then loosen a toll-ring for a bell, a showy sacrifice that wins them murmured approval they did not expect, and the Rafter Guild lowers a counterweight that thuds into the floor like a promise they can keep if others will. When Aerin’s oathstone warms against her palm during Jarik’s reading of the sealed wax scars, the hall leans in and then exhales as the stone cools at the Breathkeepers’ turn, and the Vigil takes the moment to announce a measured search of the crawls with volunteers from each faction. The rite does not name the hand, but it forges enough trust to carry a joint team into the lattice where the moth-wing etch leads, and the city steps away from the edge for one more day without losing the thread that will carry into the next mission."
