        "description": "Weather-browned woman with wind-tangled black hair usually braided with thin bone beads, steady river-grey eyes, and the posture of someone who grew up on swaying decks and ropeways. She wears pale bone-ceramic pauldrons over a storm-blue tabard marked with the Breathkeepers' spiral, and sturdy cliff boots fitted for grating and chain.",

    "class": "PALADIN",
    "history": "Born in the Undershadows to a lamplighter clan, Aerin Rell grew up listening to the bones of Vaelor sing through the decks. As a Scale-born, she could hear tones others missed, and the Breathkeepers marked her early as a ward during gale season. When a floodrise nearly tore Riverfoot free, she broke the taboo against tolling horn in clear weather to summon crews and saved a dozen children; instead of punishment, High Cantor Ysil Aer guided her to swear a variant of the Hollow Oath as a paladin of the Unbroken Breath, binding her life to the safety of Ribcrown and the sanctity of Vaelor's remains. She trained on the Gale Organ Cliffs, learned the wind-rites, and served as mediator between dockers, riggers, and market scribes. When the Chainhouse Triad suffered fatal cable scoring, Aerin rode a platform during a night patrol and discovered saboteur marks shaped like moth wings under a catwalk. Refusing a rush to scapegoat the Moth Lanterns, she pulled the emergency clutch to drop an unmanned platform, sacrificing a shipment and her standing with the Rafter Guild but saving the system from catastrophic failure. Her brother, Jarik Rell of the Vigil, pressed her to name the culprits; Aerin held her tongue, believing there was a deeper hand behind the marks. Since then she has brokered quiet truces on the Crown-Market, ferried storm-warnings upriver, and taken on a ghost-barge debt to protect Scale-born gutter kids hidden by the Lanterns. She walks the ribs as living oath and shield while the Triune Charter strains, seeking the true note beneath the noise.",

She also accepted silver from a ghost-barge to erase a debt owed by the Moth Lanterns, and fears she forgot a vital promise she once made to Jarik about naming any saboteur she found."
