Prior Asha Greyling asks you to come without cloak-show or guild-banner, to stand in the bell-room and listen for the breath between beats. The Order of the Basalt Arch believes the Loom of Tides has begun to breathe wrong, a subtle quickening like a racing heart that denies it is afraid. If the Loom stutters, prophecy says, the Starspan will split and the river will choose its own throne. She wants you, a creature of locks and oaths and culverts, to hear what most cannot: the city's rhythm tugging off-true.\\nBeneath the arch's pitted ribs you can smell iron damp and votive ribbon dye. Bellkeeper Dorn gestures to the shadowed niches where the old rock hums in sympathy. You pin a ribbon where thousands of pleas hang heavy with salt and dust, and you promise Asha to carry the Order’s omen to those who keep the cogs.

In a vault lined with oath-etched brass plates sits a seized bale of blackglass, bound in tarred canvas that shivers at midnight. It hums a note that refuses to be ignored and carries a signature you almost recognize. The Wardens want the song stilled without destroying the evidence. You know the Embersleeve’s angles and the Collegium’s appetite; between them runs a narrow channel where truth might pass without capsizing.\\nThe Citadel’s machine-gates sing their own iron psalms while Gatewrights argue about spillways.
