As a teen, Lio copied toll plates at the Scriptorium of Oaths for a pittance and memorized the shapes of binding words, discovering that promises have gears like gates do. When drought bit hard and bread went thin, Lio slipped through culverts beneath the Night Market Vaults to pass stolen grain into hungry hands. Knife-Whisper Pell noticed the talent for vanishing between tallies and offered a place within the Embersleeve, starting Lio on small mirror-oddity runs and oath-loophole scouting.\\nOn a dive at the Shattermere with friend Tavi Mireline, Lio sealed a question in a gutskin and sank it to the glass-shelves: how to cut a binding without shattering a vow. The answer came back with a price. Lio surfaced with echo-sickness and a reflection that does not quite obey. Magister Vell of the Cobalt Collegium heard about the anomaly from a glassrunner and arranged a cautious accord: in exchange for tuned chime-plates and access to the Loom of Tides' public levels, Lio would retrieve resonance samples and report on Embersleeve attempts to mask oath-tones.\\nBetween Wardens closing locks, the Glasswrights begging fuel, and the Rafter's League calling for open passage, Lio learned to move where the water goes and to read the city's heartbeat. Lio now treads a knife-line between Pell's favors and Vell's curiosities, slipping messages through the Drowned Theater's chorus and pinning votive ribbons to the Starspan at dusk. The long game is bolder than smuggling: draft a new, cleaner Oath of Flow that the Archivists might sanctify, one that shares water without handing the keys to any single hand. Until then, Lio steals time, secrets, and breath, one lock at a time.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shard-knife\",\n      \"description\": \"A blackglass blade from the Sunken Glassworks, flexible and wickedly sharp; hums faintly when near oath-lashed objects.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tide-key\",\n      \"description\": \"A skeleton key filed to mimic old Warden notch patterns for minor grates and oar-gates; unreliable on modern locks.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chime-plate E5\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm-sized sky-ore plate tuned by the Collegium to a Shattermere note; momentarily fuzzes oath-tones and mask-signals when struck softly.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Oath-scribe kit\",\n      \"description\": \"Brass-nib stylus, blue moth silk filter, vial of salt-soot vow-ink, and thin brass leaves for quick, deniable tallies.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mirror-lens locket\",\n      \"description\": \"A thumb of mirror-glass set in a locket; shows hairline oath-threads and concealed seals when angled to lamplight.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Grapple and riverline\",\n      \"description\": \"A silk rope spliced with a sky-ore hook that bites basalt and iron alike; quiet in the hand, quick to coil.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Culvert map\",\n      \"description\": \"An annotated scrap-map of spillways and Night Market runnels, marked with a symbol for a hidden wheel that opens a lockside sluice.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Starshard grit vial\",\n      \"description\": \"A pinch of resonant grit used in Collegium tests; scattered on glass, it dampens echoes for a dozen breaths and stains fingertips cobalt.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Switch-raft token\",\n      \"description\": \"A carved reed token that buys a quiet tow from sympathetic Rafter's League crews when signals cannot be flown.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 10,\n    \"agility\": 16,\n    \"constitution\": 12,\n    \"intelligence\": 15,\n    \"wisdom\": 11,\n    \"charisma\": 13,\n    \"dexterity\": 18,\n    \"endurance\": 12,\n    \"perception\": 17,\n    \"luck\": 14\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Oath-law savvy and contract parsing\",\n    \"Stealth and urban infiltration\",\n    \"Social engineering and fast talk\",\n    \"River navigation and culvert mapping\",\n    \"Acoustic mimicry and signal-whistle code\",\n    \"Appraisal of glass and resonance curios\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Tavi Mireline\": \"Shattermere dive partner and closest confidant; Tavi pulled Lio free when the echo-sickness first struck and now acts as a moral keel, urging Lio to petition the Archivists instead of the Embersleeve when trouble bites.\",\n    \"Knife-Whisper Pell\": \"Sponsor within the Embersleeve and sometime tormentor; Pell saved Lio's skin after a failed grain-run but holds a ledger-debt that can be called at any dusk.
