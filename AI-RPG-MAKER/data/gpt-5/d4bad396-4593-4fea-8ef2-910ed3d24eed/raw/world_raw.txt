"{\n  \"city\": \"Miravale, the River Crown, rises where three braided rivers collide beneath a natural basalt arch called the Starspan. The city is tiered upon islands, embankments, and locking canals, all linked by iron-limbed bridges and oar-gates that sing when the flood comes. Its people are boatwrights and bargers, glasswrights and oath-scribes, wind-chanting watermen, rivermancers, and archivists who bind vows to brass plates and riverstone. At dusk the Starspan glows with trapped starlight and pilgrims pin votive ribbons to its pitted skin, begging it not to crack.\\n\\nFounding legends claim Miravale began as a flood camp around a fallen skyfire shard that melted the river sand into a pane so wide it could mirror the moon. Six families swore a Tide-Pledge there: to share water and passage, to bind all trade to open tallies, and to seat a rotating City Chair each flood-turn. For two hundred years that pledge held, renewed in the Scriptorium of Oaths over bowls of river-water and salt. Now, drought and ambition strain it thread-thin. The Wardens of the Confluence ration flow; the Rafter's League mutters that the locks close too often; the Glasswrights' Syndicate feeds its kilns with precious driftwood and peat, casting sun-glass that fetches kings' ransoms; and the Embersleeve moves contraband beneath the Night Market Vaults where the river's old cisterns drum like whale-bellies.\\n\\nMiravale depends on upland grain caravans and Skytooth ore, on salt from the Giant's Stair and tar from Blackroot Forest. It sells law (oath-binding), glass (sun-shot, mirror-smooth, shard-singing), and passage (by lock or raft). The Cobalt Collegium hums strange turbines in the Loom of Tides to keep channels breathing; the Order of the Basalt Arch prays the Starspan's fractures remain hairline; the Archivists of Vow keep the city's memory in plates of etched brass, weighing every signature against a chorus of witnesses. All the while, whispers say something in the Shattermere hums back when the city sings.\\n\\nConflicts churn beneath the surface. The Grain Compact squeezes granaries to leverage water for wheat. The Wardens have seized two Embersleeve barges and a bale of blackglass that sings at midnight. House Thalen funds restorations on the Old Aurion Aqueduct, claiming it will break the drought; the Rafter's League calls it a vanity whose flow will favor whoever owns the first sluice. And each equinox, the Order of the Basalt Arch repeats their prophecy: if the Loom of Tides ever stutters for a day and night, the Starspan will split and the river will choose its own throne.\",\n  \"surroundings\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shattermere\",\n      \"description\": \"A crater-lake north of Miravale where a star fragment slammed into the floodplain, fusing sand into mirrored shelves and glass islands.
