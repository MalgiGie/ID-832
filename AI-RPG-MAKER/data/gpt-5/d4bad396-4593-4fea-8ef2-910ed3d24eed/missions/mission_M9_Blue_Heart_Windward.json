    "description": "The wind at Skytooth Ridge tries to carve you into a cleaner shape. Harn Slate sends word that a humming cobalt vein near Harn’s Step threatens to collapse unless its resonance is relieved. Magister Vell believes a tuned core from that vein could ease the Loom’s ghost-harmonic and keep the Starspan from quivering. Griffons nest on ledges of blue stone with hurricane eyes. Knife-winds strip warmth and pride with equal efficiency. The vein sings the same note as the Shattermere on a cold moon-night, reminding you that the city’s breath is borrowed from older throats.\nThe climb is a negotiation with the mountain and with your own knees. You carry starshard grit and a promise to return with something the size of your fist and twice as polite as a thunderhead.",

Chip too hard and the whole ledge will come down singing on your head. Take the core where the color turns darkest blue and the song feels like it’s looking at you back."

If we can teach the machine to breathe with the ridge instead of against it, the ghost-harmonic might settle. If it does, remind your monk friends that science can kneel without breaking its back."
