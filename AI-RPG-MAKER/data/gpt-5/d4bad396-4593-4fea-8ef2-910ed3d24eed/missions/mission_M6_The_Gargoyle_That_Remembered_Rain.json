    "description": "A gargoyle on the Old Aurion Aqueduct woke when a Collegium experiment sang too near its stone. Now it waits with dry tongue and aching throat, shedding dust as if it were scales. House Thalen needs it soothed and the siphon valves replaced before any public trial of flow makes them look like dreamers with broken toys. The wind on the arches tastes of snow and old risk. Harn Slate, a miner from Skytooth Ridge, meets you at Harn’s Step with ropes and a prayer that sounds like a curse.\nBandits nest in hollow piers and watch like crows, waiting to sell your bones to whoever writes the truest elegy. The gargoyle’s eyes are dry and hateful until you pour a skin of water down its stone gullet and it shudders like a creature hearing its name after too long.",

Harn, wedge that valve like you’re convincing a door it meant to open all along. If the bandits want the view, they can have it after we’re done."
