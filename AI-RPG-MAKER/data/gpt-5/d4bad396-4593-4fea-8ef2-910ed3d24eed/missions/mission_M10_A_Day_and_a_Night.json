    "description": "Equinox arrives with bells and unease. The Order’s prophecy calls for a day and a night without stutter. The Loom of Tides thrums with fresh resonance and fear. Someone means to make it cough. The Embersleeve’s decoy chime has bought you a map of fingerprints, and Captain Maera has crews ready to crank by hand if you can keep saboteurs from cutting the belts that sing like river-serpents. The Starspan listens, counting cracks with patient malice older than politics.\nThe engine-house steams and whispers. You can smell the night market on one saboteur’s sleeves and the glassworks on another’s palms. Between the Wardens’ keys and the Collegium’s numbers lies a trust that could shatter or set. If you can hold rhythm steady until dawn kisses dusk again, the city will have bought itself more time than money can buy.",

Play the mirror-plate now, just a hair under E5, and then—good—ease it down. The belts won’t like it, but they don’t get a vote. Neither do the men who thought they could bully physics with a smuggled scale."
