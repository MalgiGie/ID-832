    "description": "You return to the place where questions are paid for in reflections: the Shattermere. The crater-lake lies north of Miravale like a torn eye, its mirrored shelves catching moonlight and returning it as knives. Tavi Mireline tightens the straps on your dive harness and smiles like someone rehearsing bravery. The Glasswrights’ Syndicate would sell permits to drown you, but the Archivists embargo unlicensed retrievals to protect divers from echo-sickness. You know how to step between orders when the water is watching, and you carry a sealed gutskin with a question written in salt-soot: how to cut bindings without shattering a vow.\nThe water is too clear and your reflection lags a heartbeat in the locket on your chest, as if deciding whether to follow. Down where the moon-maddened eels cradle themselves against glass reefs, the hum changes phase and your bones remember that sound from the Loom. When the Mirror-Queen answers, it is not in words but in the way your breath mistimes and then learns a new rhythm.",

If you must ask the Mirror-Queen another price, make it something you can afford to give twice. I don’t want to pull you to the surface and wonder whose eyes I’ve brought back."

Bring me superstition, and I will tally every breath you took as a debt. My kilns are hungry, Fenwater. Do not feed them ghost stories when I asked for glass."

Tavi, when we go down, count to your heartbeat and mine together. If the echo in me slips a step, tug twice. I’m not trading anything I can’t live without. I’ve done that once, and the Moor still knows how to say me sideways in the reeds."

Change the rhythm, and the binding bends without breaking; sharpen your breath to the edge of mercy. Pay in a memory given to water, and the water will remember you are kind."
