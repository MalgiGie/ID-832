    "description": "The Scriptorium requires sacred salt for the final binding, and the Giant’s Stair Salt Flats hold it like a choir of mirrors under the sun. Ressa Quay, now out of custody and working contrition into coin, leads a salt run to fetch enough purity to sting signatures into permanence. The flats glitter with heat mirages and the edges of old promises. Salt-wasps hunt sweat; drownholes hide beneath crust that looks solid until it remembers it is not. The Grain Compact whispers of withholding shipments to squeeze the city one more notch. The Wardens will open passage for the return if you bring the salt and keep the caravan from burning alive.\nThe flats step down like a broken staircase into a blue horizon. Each pan has its own song—wind over brine, the crack of new crust, the whisper of names the Dead Tide remembers. You will carry more than mineral back; you will carry the right to make pain meaningful.",

The flats taught me patience; every step lies a little, and every lie looks like solid ground until it swallows you. Keep your eyes on the wind, not the white, and we’ll bring back enough sting to make men tell the truth when it matters."
