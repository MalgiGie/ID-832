    "description": "Word of your hands near the singing bale reaches the darkest corners before your boots dry. Knife-Whisper Pell requests—never summons, never pleads—that you meet beneath the glowmoss of the Night Market Vaults where promises come salted and cheap. Pell speaks like a blade being honed: soft, regular, and ready to make someone else bleed. The Embersleeve wants the Wardens deaf to certain tones and the Collegium looking at the wrong gears. They ask for a decoy chime-plate, something that will make the singing bale seem tame while another melody slips into the Loom like a thief into a sleeping house. You remember who pulled you out of a cell once and who would put you back for spite.\nStalls burn fish-oil and strong liquor, and the shrine to the Mirror-Queen blinks back with bead-glass eyes. Tavi hovers near the crowd’s edge, thumb grazing the scar on your palm like a prayer. Between your debt and your ambition runs a current no polemaster could sound in the dark.",

I have kept your ledger ink from drying hard more than once. Now I ask for a single note misplaced so that a different song may be sung. I do not want a war, Lio. I want the Wardens to remember they are not kings, and the Collegium to remember that machines are tools, not thrones."

But there’s a line between misdirection and betrayal so thin that sometimes you only see it after you’ve bled on it. If I place a decoy, it will scream to anyone who knows my hand that something was placed. And if you call that a failure, then call me that to my face."

If you give Pell a toy, make sure it has splinters. And if you must be clever, be clever toward the living—the bread-eaters and the water-haulers—not toward the men with ledgers who think your echo is a coin they can spend twice."

I can craft a plate with a telltale flutter, a bird with a broken feather you can spot mid-flight if you know how to look. If Pell’s people put their fingers in the Loom with that in hand, I’ll have the imprint of every touch. But—be warned—Pell will know you set the stage for someone else to hear the play."
