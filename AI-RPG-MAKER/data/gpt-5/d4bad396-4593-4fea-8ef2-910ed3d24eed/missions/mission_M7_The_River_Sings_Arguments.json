    "description": "The Drowned Theater fills its floating stage with lanterns and wagers. A public performance will sway the city’s heart faster than a docket can, and Pellar Nine-Poles wants the river to hear the Oath of Flow as a ballad people can hum without choking. House Thalen funds the stage, the Rafter’s League supplies the chorus, and rumor says a siren choir will test how far song can loosen lashings. If vows can be softened by melody, they can be hardened with harmony. Your mirror-plate and chime-plate together might turn the night to your favor.\nBackstage smells of oiled wood and nerves. You place resonant dampeners in the beams while Lady Seska Thalen primes actors with lines sharpened to pierce pride. The audience is a jury that pays in applause and rumor. If the Embersleeve plan to slip their tone into the Loom, they may rehearse on this stage first.",

        "Coordinate with Pellar Nine-Poles to develop a pro-Oath set list that speaks to bread, water, and fairness",

Give them a chorus they can shout on the way home and they’ll forgive their own hunger long enough to think kindly of the hands that feed them. But don’t you dare lie to them with pretty words. If we promise water and give them sand, they’ll drown us in it and be right to do so."
