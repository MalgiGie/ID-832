    "description": "Captain Maera Lockfen summons you to the River Crown Citadel where the stone sweats with lock-mist and the Wardens’ ink dries faster than their temper. In a vault lined with oath-etched brass plates sits a seized bale of blackglass, bound in tarred canvas that shivers at midnight. It hums a note that refuses to be ignored and carries a signature you almost recognize. The Wardens want the song stilled without destroying the evidence. You know the Embersleeve’s angles and the Collegium’s appetite; between them runs a narrow channel where truth might pass without capsizing.\nThe Citadel’s machine-gates sing their own iron psalms while Gatewrights argue about spillways. Maera’s eyes are a flint that chooses when to spark. She gives you space and a warning: if this bale ties Embersleeve blades to the Loom’s pulse, she will cut deep and expect your hand on the knife, but not on the throat.",

This bale sings wrong, and city folk who sleep lightly are starting to dream about water walking off with their faces. I won’t have panic. I will have answers that stand up in a hall of witnesses."

            "text": "If the song is a key, it might be turning a lock in more than just ears. Blackglass keeps secrets the way a canal keeps silt: it settles until something stirs it. I can take notes without waking what’s sleeping in there, and I’ll carry a sketch to Vell that’s clean of custody stains. But if the hum maps to oath-tones, someone meant it to slip through ledgers like an eel through hands."

I never heard the bale sing until the Wardens dragged me out of my bed by the toe. If there’s a signature in that sound, it isn’t mine, and if I’d known, I’d have tied a stone to the damn thing and given it to the bottom."

The Loom’s hum is developing a ghost-harmonic; I will not say cause, not yet. But if this bale hums the same ghost, then we have a conversation to hold at a different volume with different listeners."

Keep your pattern to yourself and write that choice on brass, so that when this goes to the Scriptorium I can say I asked you clean and you chose eyes-open. Either way, step carefully; I won’t forgive a lie, but I’ve forgiven worse told to my face."
