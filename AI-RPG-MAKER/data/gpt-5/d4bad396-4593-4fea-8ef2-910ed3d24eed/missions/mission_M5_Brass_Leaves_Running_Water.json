    "description": "Preceptor Iven Kall of the Archivists of Vow receives you in a hall that smells of salt and brass. He sets out thin leaves ready to carry words that will be weighed against witnesses and time. You propose the bones of a new Oath of Flow—keys shared on festival days, right-of-way along the aqueduct arches, fuel rationing guided by need not coin, and the Loom’s tempo eased on ritual slow-flow days. The Archivists will docket the hearing if you bring more than ideas; you must bring concessions signed by those who clutch the river like a hoarded blanket.\nYou walk Miravale like a scribe and a thief at once, taking promises not with steal and blade, but with language and the threat of shame. Each faction eyes your brass leaves as if they were mirrors that will show their worst angles, and you sell them a better reflection with careful clauses.",

Build them right and the first soul to sign finds themselves standing higher than they imagined, and grateful for the view. Bring me signatures and I will bring you witnesses who remember.

My crews deserve sleep without the Loom barking orders into their dreams. You tell Iven I will hand over ceremonial control on festival days to a board of three—one Warden, one Archivist, one monk from the Arch—and I will live with the paperwork."

Put that clause in, and you can nail my name to it. But if they close for the sake of swagger, I will undo your words with song and rope until the city remembers who keeps it fed."

I will sign if the Collegium insures the spans against mishap and the Wardens post ward-poles where the gargoyles brood. Write it, and I will put my name where my pride can read it later without choking."

Put me on a panel where I can see who is skimming, and I will give what I can without breaking the glass that keeps us paid."
