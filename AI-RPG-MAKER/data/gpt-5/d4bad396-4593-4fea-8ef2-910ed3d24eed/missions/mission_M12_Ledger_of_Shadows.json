    "description": "Night gathers under the Starspan, and votive ribbons lift like fins in a slow current. Knife-Whisper Pell stands where the arch’s shadow falls sharpest. They hold a ledger of secrets and your name waits open on a page. Embersleeve lieutenants still weep salt-blood tears for a broken Oath of Silence, and Pell offers a bargain: cut the curse and carry a debt, or refuse and watch the Vaults become a wound the city can’t stop licking. You came to write better bindings, not sharper punishments. The Mirror-Queen’s plate warms at your chest with the memory of a rhythm that bends without breaking.\nTavi watches from the rail with a face like a storm deciding whether to break. Asha’s bells hang nearby, ready to ring mercy or warning. The river under you makes its own argument in hush and slap. Whatever you do, it will remember.",

My people are not villains from a playhouse. They are mouths that learned to stay quiet because talking cost teeth. Free them from salt and I will leash my knives to your new rules, at least while they keep me fed."
