    "appearance": {
        "description": "Lean and river-quick, with canal-tanned skin, storm-grey eyes, and black hair cropped to avoid snagging in gears or reeds. Wears a reversible cloak the color of wet stone, soft-soled canal boots, and a belt of pouches marked in low-key flow glyphs.",
        "distinctive_signs": "A faint, constant echo to the voice in still rooms; the reflection in polished glass lags by a heartbeat. A salt-bowl scar across the left palm and a thin mirrored shard set in a locket at the throat."

    "class": "Rogue",
    "history": "Lio Fenwater grew up on the lock-stairs below the River Crown Citadel, running errands for barge crews and learning the Wardens' hand signals by mimicry. As a teen, Lio copied toll plates at the Scriptorium of Oaths for a pittance and memorized the shapes of binding words, discovering that promises have gears like gates do. When drought bit hard and bread went thin, Lio slipped through culverts beneath the Night Market Vaults to pass stolen grain into hungry hands. Knife-Whisper Pell noticed the talent for vanishing between tallies and offered a place within the Embersleeve, starting Lio on small mirror-oddity runs and oath-loophole scouting.\nOn a dive at the Shattermere with friend Tavi Mireline, Lio sealed a question in a gutskin and sank it to the glass-shelves: how to cut a binding without shattering a vow. The answer came back with a price. Lio surfaced with echo-sickness and a reflection that does not quite obey. Magister Vell of the Cobalt Collegium heard about the anomaly from a glassrunner and arranged a cautious accord: in exchange for tuned chime-plates and access to the Loom of Tides' public levels, Lio would retrieve resonance samples and report on Embersleeve attempts to mask oath-tones.\nBetween Wardens closing locks, the Glasswrights begging fuel, and the Rafter's League calling for open passage, Lio learned to move where the water goes and to read the city's heartbeat. Lio now treads a knife-line between Pell's favors and Vell's curiosities, slipping messages through the Drowned Theater's chorus and pinning votive ribbons to the Starspan at dusk. The long game is bolder than smuggling: draft a new, cleaner Oath of Flow that the Archivists might sanctify, one that shares water without handing the keys to any single hand. Until then, Lio steals time, secrets, and breath, one lock at a time.",
