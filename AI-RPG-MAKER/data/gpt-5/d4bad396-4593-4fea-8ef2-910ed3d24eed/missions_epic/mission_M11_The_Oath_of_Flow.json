    "description": "The Scriptorium of Oaths breathes like a cathedral-lung, damp with the breath of witnesses and the clean sting of brine. Brass plates, tall as shields and thin as songs, catch the lamplight and return it in disciplined gold, each etched line a groove where memory will not slip. The Tide-Pledge bowl sits on its dais in reverent fracture, a crack like lightning held forever in the glaze, reminding every gaze that even sacred things must be mended by steady hands. Your own salt-bowl rests beside it, clear water salted just enough to bite the skin, a witchy mirror that will remember every finger it drinks. The river hums through the hall in muffled rumor, and your reflection in the bowl lags a heartbeat behind your face, the old Shattermere echo in your bones clicking its tongue like a fretful patron. Leaders arrive not as people but as weather, posture flashing like banners: Maera Lockfen with storm-hard jaw and the smell of rope and oil; Sere Aven polished and furnace-keen, her palms as clean as a ledger that has seen too much; Pellar Nine-Poles with her laughter honed into a blade that will cut a toll in pride; Orin Thalen ironed into patience that creaks; Asha Greyling walking with the quiet equivalence of bells; and Magister Vell bearing calculations like stacked glass, dangerous only when the stack teeters. You feel your echo judge you in the silent beats between speeches, and somewhere in the remembered dark the Mirror-Queen's admonition flickers: change the rhythm and the binding bends without breaking. If the city has a throat, today you will place your fingers upon it and teach it to sing without choking.",

            "lines": "Speak plainly and without charm, Lio Fenwater, because charm is the first plank to float away when a flood takes the bridge. Charm breaks first when strain comes, and this city has been strained until its oaths sing like glass cooling too fast. Tell them not only what they gain but precisely what they must surrender, and tell it with a voice steady enough to stitch a wound. The Scriptorium remembers the taste of cowardice, and I will not let it feed twice on the same fear, not while I keep these plates breathing and these bowls clean. If your words wobble, the river will hear the wobble and copy it, and then the arch will wobble, and then the people will wobble, and then disaster will stand on our shoulders to see better. Place your hand in the salt, let it bite you true, and let the sting be proof that you mean to stand beside what you bind."

            "lines": "The Syndicate does not dance to bells alone, however artfully they are rung, and I say that with respect for stone and prayer both. I will not sign a clause that lets my kilns go cold because a monk heard a bell dream of mercy, nor will I pretend that cooling glass does not fracture livelihoods as cleanly as it fractures plates. Write it so that ration nights rotate by public tally and seal, not by whisper, and carve penalties that bite: cheaters will carry shard-sand in their shoes until they learn to step softly on other people’s throats. Write it so that when a big run is lit, the smoke we send up is a beacon that guarantees our turn rather than an invitation for rivals to game the gate. Do that, and I will cut my greed down to something the city can fit its hands around, and we will pay into peat and pitch without screaming that every ember is an emergency."

If a child falls from my arches, the city will not crucify my name for building what it begged me to raise, not when wind and weather and the negligence of a dozen other hands conspire. Write the Collegium’s insurance into the oath in ink that will not wash, a pooled fund with rules clear enough that even my enemies will admit when it pays and when it does not. Mandate the Order’s ward-poles and carve their bell-glyphs into the stones at every dangerous turn, so that when the wind moans the arches will hum a warning even to drunks and dreamers. Put my name beside yours on a brass leaf, so that in twenty years we can both read it and feel pride rather than nausea, and if it fails I will come to break it with you in daylight instead of in secret at night."

I will have language as clean as cold iron that says in immediate crisis the Wardens can override with an Archivist witness present, not tomorrow, not after a runner finds a stamp, but in the same breath that the water rises. Put it down that we are answerable for every turn of the key we take and that you will measure us by action rather than rumor, and I will be measured gladly. Make it clear that no clerk will fish a drowning barge with forms, and no noble will delay a chain-boom with pride. Give my crews the right to move when the flood moves, and I will teach them to bow when the flood bows, because oath and current must be one rulebook if anyone is to live."

Put in writing that passage windows will be publicly posted a week ahead and that lock-sits end when the schedule holds, and we will tie our switch-rafts to your song for a season. Inscribe that if the Wardens close a gate out of turn, they must open three in recompense before the month is done, and the League will take that as a promise worth wetting. Name a witness-roster composed of people who have stood waist-deep at a jammed boom and bled from rope-burn, and we will bless them with our whistles. Do this, and I will laugh in your favor instead of at your expense, and my laughter will travel faster than the river when it wants to, because rumor is a current too."

The Order will tie our bells to this oath and listen for its groans the way a midwife listens for a baby’s first complaint, so we can slacken before it screams and destroys its own lungs. Write slow-flow days into the calendar like ribs, regular and strong, so commerce learns to breathe like a person and not like a pump that kills itself trying to be a heart. Let our laywatchers mark the ward-poles and teach children how to hear the difference between a river’s hunger and a river’s patience. Put my mark where the slow days live, and I will answer for them in public when merchants howl, and I will remind them that a day of mercy now prevents a year of mourning later."

The Collegium signs with the understanding that if experiment touches oath again, we are the first to confess it and the first to shut our own doors until the bells forgive us. We will fund the insurance pool from measured tariffs on machines and mining rather than the bread of the poor, and we will publish our ledgers in numerals the river can read. We will tune chime-plates to the Shattermere notes you already know too well and mount them in the engine-house so that resonance warns us before metal pretends it is god. If we fail in this compact, censure us in daylight and with song, and we will stand still to hear it rather than scurry into the night like rats with bright ideas."

Rotation of ration nights by public tally posted at the locks and the shrine, with penalties underfoot for cheaters and recompense for those unjustly delayed. Liability insured from a Collegium pool with rules named plainly, the Order’s ward-poles mandated wherever arch meets wind, and maintenance etched so neglect cannot pretend it was an accident. Keys ceded to a triad on festival days, one Warden, one Archivist, one citizen chosen by lot from those who know rope-burn, with Warden override in imminent threat and never without witness or a plate cut explaining why. There is mercy in the rhythm and steel in the frame, and we name slow-flow days so the city remembers to breathe, and I offer my palm to the salt to say I will carry these words when they grow heavy. Sign, and we bend the city into a shape that can hold water without drowning itself, and if it breaks I will help break it cleaner rather than let it shatter in secret."

            "text": "You place the Order’s slow-flow days at the heart of the oath and speak them like ribs that will keep the city from collapsing on its own lungs. You promise public rotation of ration nights locked to those days so no guild may quietly steal the dark for itself. You describe bells hung not as ornaments but as instruments, tuned to warn of strain and to time the breath of commerce, and you require market shutters to rise and fall by that rhythm. You assure Sere Aven that rotation is ledger-certain and that her big runs will stand in daylight rather than be strangled in alley whispers, and you assure Pellar Nine-Poles that passage windows bend to the same calendar. You pledge that the Loom’s tempo will be published as a daily hymn, with the Collegium’s hand upon the metronome and the Archivists’ eyes upon the notes.",
            "outcome": "The Order signs first, bells shimmering like gentle rain beneath the arch of the Scriptorium, and their assent steadies hands that were shaking. The Collegium follows with clipped pride, accepting that rhythm is a science as much as a prayer, and they commit to publish the Loom’s pulse. The Wardens grumble but find the override language intact, and Maera grants a nod like a click of a lock that fits. The Glasswrights hedge until the rotation schedule is etched before witnesses, then Sere sets her mark with a cool smile that says fairness costs but costs less than chaos. The Rafter’s League laughs in approval, rumor turning in your favor by dusk, and the city learns its first slow breath; the Starspan bells ring that night with your name woven into the measure."

You tell Maera Lockfen that no scribe will fish a drowning barge with forms, and you lay down the witness-roster ahead of time, chosen from people who know rope-burn and flood-eyes. You assure the Archivists that each override cuts a brass leaf of explanation before the day dies, and that those plates will hang where citizens can spit or praise as they see fit. You promise the League that every override spends debt that must be worked off in open gates before the month ends, turning crisis power into a ledger that bites back. You keep the slow-flow days, but you frame them inside iron, so no one mistakes ritual for softness.",
            "outcome": "The Wardens sign with shoulders that finally drop, and for the first time in weeks Maera’s jaw unclenches as if a stone were taken from it. The Archivists accept the public plate requirement and appoint a witness-corps before the ink dries, making oversight feel less like theater and more like teeth. The Glasswrights eye the stronger emergency language and insist upon a fairness clause for recompense when overrides cut their runs; you grant it with clear limits, and Sere concedes. The Rafter’s League applauds the debt-for-gate measure but warns that any abuse will call a lock-sit at once, and Pellar’s laughter carries the threat like perfume. The oath sanctifies cleanly, but protests bloom like algae in certain channels; you win a sturdy compact at the cost of a restless chorus you must soothe in the next turning."

You demand the Syndicate pledge to cut export quotas during declared famine weeks, making space for grain and medicine without slaughtering their craft. You build a carve-out that allows emergency glass for the Loom and the Wardens when the city’s water-bones need splints, so no one pretends art alone gets to drink. You ask the League to haul peat from Whispering Moor under Warden escort, and you promise public tallies that show who burns what and when, so rumor will not need to guess. You keep the slow-flow days intact and underline that the rhythm protects kilns from whiplash and people from hunger.",
            "outcome": "Sere Aven signs with a look that blends respect and calculation, because the schedule keeps her fires alive while the famine carve-out paints her as a citizen rather than a queen. The League signs with a shrug and a smirk when the peat-haul clause earns them coin and goodwill, and they swear the reed roads will sing with carts until the drought eases. The Wardens grumble about escort duty, but Maera agrees when you tie the duty to insurance credits and public thanks, and the Archivists smile at the transparency clauses. The Order approves the rhythm preserved, though Asha warns softly that the Moor must be courted with care; you note it, hearing blue moths in your mind. The oath holds and the bells ring, but whispers rise from the Moor about iron left in hollows, hinting that you have bargained with a forest spirit’s patience and must renew that bargain soon."

You tell yourself it is only prudence, leverage to keep the Embersleeve from slicing at the oath’s edges, a hidden wheel that might open if the city chokes on its own law. You mask the language in generalized terms about community representatives from the quay and the vaults, and you time your reading to fall under a chorus of murmurs. You feel your reflection lag and look away, hearing the Mirror-Queen’s warning like a finger on glass. You press forward anyway, thinking of debts called at dusk and the thin mercy of a syndicate’s smile when it is given something it did not have to steal.",
            "outcome": "Iven Kall’s eyes cut to you like a cold bell when a junior Archivist recognizes the phrase and clears their throat, and the murmurs die into a predatory hush. The Wardens stiffen and Maera’s hand drops to the key at her belt, while Pellar Nine-Poles raises her brows and pretends her laughter is a cough. You withdraw the clause in the silence you have made, and you speak contrition in sentences that taste of salt, promising to keep the oath’s spine free of shadows. The Archivists accept the correction but cool the room by three degrees, and Iven warns you with a look that will follow you into future halls. The oath still passes after hard pruning, but the Embersleeve’s favor warms you like a fever you cannot admit you caught; the next turning will ask what you bought and what you sold to yourself."
