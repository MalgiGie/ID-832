    "description": "You return to the place where questions are paid for in reflections: the Shattermere. North of Miravale, the crater-lake lies like a torn eye in the valley’s skull, its mirrored shelves catching moonlight and returning it as knives that blink and breathe with the wind. Oar-quiet and bell-clear, the waters hum a tone you feel in your teeth and along the old echo-thread behind your ears, the same crooked rhythm the Loom of Tides sometimes stutters toward on hard drought nights. At the water’s lip, votive ribbons from the Starspan have drifted here and snagged in reeds, and each one seems to pull at the skin of your memory as if begging its way back upstream. Tavi Mireline tightens the straps on your dive harness with hands that have hauled you from this lake once before, smiling the practiced smile of someone who knows fear and will not be moved by it, not while you watch. The Glasswrights’ Syndicate would sell permits to drown you if they could tally the bubbles, and the Archivists of Vow embargo unlicensed retrievals to keep divers from swallowing the Shattermere’s songs; both measures are meant to be merciful, and both are also nets. But you know the culverts and the small bells of bureaucracy, and you carry a sealed gutskin with a question written in salt-soot and stitched with your patience: how to cut bindings without shattering a vow. The locket at your throat lags your reflection by a heartbeat as if it were deciding whether to follow, and the mirror-shelves below flex like the ribs of some sleeping leviathan made of glass. When you and Tavi slip into the chill, moon-maddened eels coil in crevices like runes for danger, and the hum below changes phase until your bones answer, remembering the Loom’s deep-bell call. If the Mirror-Queen answers again, you know it will not be in words but in breath and rhythm and the tilt of your heartbeat, in the way water claims a memory from you and gives you back a method shaped like mercy.",

            "lines": "I hate the way this lake watches, like it learned to see by breaking light into knives and never forgot the pleasure. It makes you feel like a child caught stealing fruit, only the fruit is your face and every bite leaves a different mouth on your bones. But I’ll go where you go, Lio, because I remember the count of your breath when the hum turned wicked and I pulled you back by your belt and a prayer. If you must ask the Mirror-Queen another price, make it something you can afford to give twice, because once is never enough for water and names, and you know it as well as I do. Promise me one thing before we slip under: if you feel the echo pull your voice away again, you tug twice and you come up even if the answer is still shivering in the dark, because I would rather have you angry and alive than clever and hollow."

            "lines": "Divers die for less than stubbornness every drought-year, Fenwater, and stubbornness is the cheapest fuel for a kiln that burns lives instead of wood. Bring me a plate the size of my palm, clear as first frost and free of hairline fractures, and I will forget to tally a permit for you, which is to say I will charge you by silence instead of by ink. Bring me superstition wrapped in reed-string and I will tally every breath you took as a debt, because my books must balance when the river does not. My kilns are hungry and the Syndicate's honor is hungrier, and we do not feed either with ghost stories when I asked for glass and profit both. Walk in saying you love Miravale and I will nod; walk out with a clean plate in your hands and I will believe you meant the city and not your own legend."

            "lines": "I will bring you glass that sings true, Guildmother, and I’ll keep superstition for places where it knows my name and still forgives me for speaking out of turn. Tavi, when we go down, count to your heartbeat and mine together, braid them like tow-lines, and if the echo in me slips a step or starts to chase itself, tug twice and I will kick for the bright no matter how sweet the hum tastes. I am not trading anything I can’t live without, not again; I already gave a true name to the Moor-Sibyl and learned how long a reed can remember a mistake. I’ve got starshard grit to soothe the Mirror-Queen’s ringing, and I’ve got a chime-plate tuned to E5 to smear the oath-tones if they try to hook me like a fish; I am going to ask for a way to bend rope without cutting it, not how to unmake promises or people. If we walk back to Miravale with a plate and a method shaped like mercy, perhaps the river will forgive us for trying to hold it too tight."

            "lines": "The Scriptorium is not blind to hunger, nor are we deaf to the river when it tries to teach by breaking our toys, child, but we are sworn to weigh every signature against witness and water both. You bring me a sealed question in salt-soot and a face the lake already knows, and I hear both caution and compulsion twined in your voice, which is a rope that can pull a city into safety or into a whirl. I can bless a dive not because I crave the plate you will bring back, but because I cannot stand to watch another oath turn into a weapon for those who hold the locks or the ledgers too tightly. Know this: the blessing binds you as much as it shields you, and if you return with an answer we will set it to brass and not to private vault, for the law is water that must run in the open if it is to clean. Walk out with my token and you will have a witness on your breath and a duty on your palm, and if you break either, the river will find me and I will find you."

            "lines": "The Starspan hums a warning whenever the Loom’s rhythm grows greedy, and I heard that note in your echo the first time we spoke, as if the river had tucked a bell beneath your tongue. Do not mistake a blessing for armor; it is more like a hand on your shoulder when you walk a high bridge, steadying, not catching if you leap. I will teach you a slow-breath rite we use when the bells threaten to outrun us, a counting that listens more than it commands, and perhaps it will let you slip past the lake’s sharp edges without leaving too much skin behind. Promise me that if the method you bring back can save us a fracture, you will speak it where it matters and not only where it profits, because that is the only way to close cracks we cannot see. Go with patience, return with mercy, and remember that stones move when song is wrong, and they will not blame the singer so much as the conductor who forced the pace."

            "lines": "Truth for reflection, reflection for truth, and the debt is paid in faces and in breaths counted backwards until eyes learn a new river. Cut not the oath, little knife, but the knot of hands that pull it too tight, for pledges become blades when gripped in fear and greed. Change the rhythm and the binding bends without breaking; sharpen your breath to the edge of mercy and let the tone do what steel cannot, and you will carry the cut without a wound. Pay me in a memory given to water, one you love enough that it pains you to release it and small enough that you do not drown, and the water will remember you as kind and leave your reflection mostly yours. Take this plate and listen to it with your fingertips first and your ears second, for it speaks in the soft knock of forgiveness and the mean hiss of pride easing its grip."

Your eyes are yours, if a little brighter, and the echo in your voice is sitting one step closer like a dog that finally found a warm stone. The plate is cold but not cruel, and when I tilt it to the moon I can hear the way it wants us to move, not to slash or sever, but to shiver the knot loose like a wet rope under patient fingers. If this is the Soft-Cut you wanted, then maybe we can cut a city free without bleeding it white, and maybe the Wardens and the League can be led instead of forced. Let’s get out of this water before the eels remember we came through without paying in skin, and you can tell me what memory you let go so I can keep a place for it in my head."

            "text": "You approach the Sunken Glassworks before dusk, the furnaces breathing like sleeping beasts and the starfire shard turning in its chains with a tired glow. You lay out a clean cloth, show the Guildmother your gutskin and the steadiness of your hands, and promise a plate the size of her palm unmarred by hairline fractures, as clear as the first frost struck off the River Crown. You offer her not money but silence: no registry entry, no Archivist witness, merely a ledger of breath she may choose not to count if your work pleases. You speak of the city’s drought and the weight of Winter’s ration lists, and how a method that eases bindings could spare her guild the war of oaths that makes glass shatter in hands that need cups not knives. Sere Aven listens, the creases by her eyes hard as annealed edges, and in the end she taps the table once and names a number that sounds like mercy because it hurts just less than pride.",
            "outcome": "The Guildmother grants you a temporary pass that will not survive an audit but will open mouths and doors along the quay for one night, and her guards recognize you as fragile freight under their gaze rather than a thief. In exchange, she claims a right of first look on any plate you surface, promising not to keep the answer but to hear its song and judge its profit-safety, and you nod because the lake is colder than a guildmaster’s suspicion. The Wardens along the lockside narrow their eyes when a Glasswright runner vouches for you, and you feel the ledger-hook slide into your name, a reminder that debts can be tallied in silence as easily as in ink. If you return with a flawed plate, the debt will multiply like cracks in heat; if you return with a perfect one, you will have bought a single run of neutrality, and a question will sit in the Guildmother’s throat like a pearl and a pebble. Tavi leaves the meeting pale but composed, and on the way to the Shattermere she says she hopes you have not traded one oath for a shelf of glass promises that can cut you when the water turns."

            "id": "C2",
            "title": "Petition the Scriptorium of Oaths for a blessing and witness",
            "text": "You carry your gutskin to the Scriptorium of Oaths where brass plates rustle as if they had leaves, and the air tastes of salt and ink and discipline. Before Preceptor Iven Kall you speak plainly, naming your intent to ask for a method that bends vows without breaking them and the harm you wish to heal in a city choking on its own rules. You accept that a blessing is not a shield but a tether to witness, and you offer that tether gladly because water turns foul in closed vessels and law is merely water that has learned to stand upright. The Preceptor listens like an old lock gate, with weight and with patience, and when he hands you a small plate stamped with the Witness Stag he warns that whatever you bring back must be set to brass in daylight, not whispered to guilds in cellars. You leave with the token cool against your palm and the knowledge that the river will be counted in your breath, both comfort and burden in equal, honest measure.",
            "outcome": "The blessing gives you lawful shade beneath which even Wardens hesitate to swing a baton, and a Witness novice follows you at a respectful distance, scribing your departure and arrival with unblinking care. The Glasswrights’ Syndicate hears of it by supper and scowls, for sanctioned dives often end with their secrets held to sunlight and their margins shaved thin; a message arrives on kiln-paper, polite, perfumed, and pointed, suggesting they will remember this choice. The Archivist’s tether steadies your echo as you descend, the hum finding less purchase in a voice that is already promised to return and speak, and the starshard grit works like a lullaby braided with law. If you return with a plate, you must present the Soft-Cut in the Scriptorium’s hall with witnesses from rival factions, and your words will be etched into brass where lies have short lives. Tavi tells you that if you were going to set your name to a clean oath someday, this is the right sort of dirt to wash your hands with first."

            "text": "You meet Knife-Whisper Pell where the cistern lamps paint the tunnels with fish-gold, the Night Market’s murmur rising and falling like a tide that forgot to listen to the moon. You admit you need a quiet way to the Shattermere that does not pass under a guild’s eye or a Warden’s tally, and Pell smiles like a cut in velvet because every favor is a hook if you let it be. The culvert map you carry already shows the hidden wheel that cracks a spillway to the open, and Pell’s fingers trace it with a lover’s indifference, praising your sense for doors while reminding you that some doors bite. You speak of paying with coin and with a share of any mirror-oddity that does not endanger the city, and Pell counters with a simpler price: one errand later, undefined, needed when needed, and you know this is how ledgers make ghosts. You accept because the river is mean and you are not a saint, and when the hidden wheel turns the water breathes out a secret and you move through it like a rumor that plans to become true.",
            "outcome": "The Embersleeve route puts you on black water before the stars have decided which faces to keep, saving you hours and witnesses, and your reflection follows only when it is sure no one else is watching. Wardens notice fresh moisture on a culvert wheel that should be dry and cold, and a report is filed with your general description shaded in, unlike the Night Market where memory is as soft as wax and just as easy to seal. Pell’s hook sits in your future like a small ache under the ribs; it does not make you slower today, but it makes you careful, and that caution keeps your breath inside your chest when the eels surge at a tone only you can hear. If you surface with a plate, you owe the Embersleeve first look at its shape even if not at its song, and refusing will cost you the sort of respect that keeps knives sheathed. Tavi watches you accept the undefined favor and says nothing at first, then later tells you in five careful words that she will drag you away from any debt that tries to drown you twice."

            "text": "You cross beneath the Starspan where prayer-bells count hairs on cracks, and the basalt arch holds your shadow like an old friend who wishes you would sleep. Prior Asha GREYLING meets you with river on her sandals and patience in her hands, inviting you to listen to the bells before you speak, because sometimes the bells answer a question you have not shaped yet. You tell her you mean to ask the Mirror-Queen for a way to loosen knots without cutting rope, and she nods as if you had admitted to loving someone dangerous, admirable, and not quite real. She teaches you a slow-breath rite used when the Loom runs hot, a counting that asks the lungs to become bridges and the blood to trust them, and you practice until your reflection stops trying to win the race your face does not know you started. Before you go she asks only that, if the method you find can save a fracture in stone or in vow, you will share it where the city can hear, not merely where a ledger can profit.",
            "outcome": "The rite steadies your echo until the lake cannot find the seam where your breath might be pried open, and it leaves you feeling held by a rhythm older than commerce and just as binding. Wardens at the bridge see Asha’s hand briefly touch your brow and decide they have more important boats to inspect than yours, and you pass with the benign invisibility that accompanies accepted ritual. The Cobalt Collegium hears rumors and grows prickly, for the Order’s blessings often come with requests for ritual slow-flow days that short the Loom’s schedule, and engineers dislike omens that argue with gears. If you return with a plate, the Order asks to ring it beneath the Starspan once before any guild claims precedence, and in exchange they promise to stand against any faction that tries to take the method private. Tavi breathes with you as you go down, counting in time to the bells that ring the cracks, and for the first time in a long time the lag in your locket feels like a companion rather than a warning."
