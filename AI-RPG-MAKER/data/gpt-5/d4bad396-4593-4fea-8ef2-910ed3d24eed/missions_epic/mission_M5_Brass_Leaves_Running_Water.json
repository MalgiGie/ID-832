    "description": "The Scriptorium of Oaths breathes with the faint sting of salt and the patient shine of brass, and the bowls on their stone plinths hold river-water that remembers everything it has touched. Preceptor Iven Kall receives you beneath lanterns that make your mirrored locket glint a heartbeat late, and the quiet chorus of witness-plates seems to lean in to hear. He lays out thin brass leaves as if setting out boats on a moon-slick channel, and each leaf waits to carry words heavy enough to change the city’s current. You speak the bones of a new Oath of Flow—keys shared on festival days, public right-of-way along the aqueduct arches, fuel rationing guided by need rather than coin, and ritual slow-flow days to ease the Loom’s relentless tempo—and the air feels suddenly thinner, as if the Starspan itself listened through the cracks in its basalt. The Archivists will docket the hearing, Iven says, but not for ideas alone; you must return with concessions etched by the very hands that clutch the river like a hoarded blanket, each name burned into metal where excuses cannot wash it clean. So you set out into Miravale, walking like a scribe and a thief at once, the canals singing in the lock-gates and the bridge-bells answering like distant witnesses. You take promises not with steal and blade but with language and a new kind of leverage: the threat of shame before the plates, the lure of being seen as a patron of the common good, the precision of clauses that leave no shadow where an old habit can hide. Every faction eyes your brass leaves as if they were mirrors that will show their worst angles, and you offer them a better reflection crafted from careful terms and the promise of shared elevation. If you succeed, the river’s heartbeat will be written into law; if you fail, the bells beneath the Starspan will ring a little sharper when the Loom stutters, and everyone will pretend it was only the wind.",

Build them wrong and the whole of Miravale scrambles up only to fall upon its own head, breaking faith and ribs in the same instant. Build them right and the first soul to sign finds themselves standing higher than they imagined, grateful for the view and unwilling to descend to older meanness. Bring me signatures that hold under the weight of witnesses, and I will bring you a hearing where memory itself will stand and nod. Bring me only good intentions and I will bring you a refusal carved so precisely into brass that the sting will teach you more than any sermon."

            "lines": "Sharing keys feels like stripping to the waist in winter, but cold honesty is better than a fevered city, and I have no love for the Loom barking orders into my crews’ dreams every holy day. Give me a board of three—a Warden with grease still under the nails, an Archivist who knows the bite of salt, and one monk from the Arch with bells in their blood—and I will hand ceremonial control on festival days without clenched teeth. I will not see panic flood the channels because a ritual turns into a parade of fools; put in a clause for emergency override when life and wall are at stake, and I will sign it with both hands. My people deserve sleep when the city professes peace, and they deserve to be seen as guardians rather than gaolers of water. Take my pledge back to Iven and tell him the Wardens will live with the paperwork if the plates live with the truth."

If the Wardens open passage for grain when bell-markers sing of bread-riots three dawns away, I will tie my boats to patience and teach my crews to hum lullabies to anger rather than anthems. Put that clause in brass where even the Night Market lamps can read it, and you can nail my name to it like a plank on a good raft. But hear me clear: if they close the locks for swagger or to make House Thalen’s banners look brighter in the Drowned Theater’s lights, I will undo your careful lines with rope and song until the city remembers who keeps it fed when ledgers run thin. Bring me a promise that grain floats before vanity, and I will give you a promise that the League’s hands will be steady even when the river coughs."

Yet I remember the first trickle House Thalen shepherded to the Theater’s steps, and I remember my grandsire’s words that an aqueduct is a spine, not a scepter, and it should carry more than a single house’s pride. I will sign if the Collegium insures the spans against mishap with coin that speaks as clearly as their chime-plates, and if the Wardens post ward-poles where the gargoyles brood so shadows do not take soles by surprise. Mark routes and rails for safe passage, carve responsibility into the stone as well as the brass, and require festival lanterns along the most treacherous runs to keep night from swallowing judgment. Write it clean enough that my grandchildren can read it without choking on my name, and I will lay my pride on the plate where it can be measured against the common good."

My kilns can run cooler on certain moon-lean nights if the city agrees to eat more barley and less sugar, and if the Wardens stop hounding my peat wagons as if they were smugglers when drought makes them crawl. Seat me on a panel where I can see who skims and who burns clean, with a Collegium technician and a Moor peat-ward to balance greed with grit, and I will cut the fire back without letting glass turn brittle in our customers’ hands. Put in inspection windows and public tallies so no one tells stories about my furnaces that do not match the smoke, and I will sign with a steady wrist. Do this, and the glass that keeps us paid will not crack under the weight of your mercy; it will ring clearer, and so will our city’s name in the markets upriver."

            "title": "Bind the Festival Keys with Bells and Breath",
            "text": "You draft a clause that marries Captain Maera’s pledge to the Order’s quiet authority, binding the festival-day keys to a bell-marked rhythm that cannot be rushed by politics or panic. You propose that any change in tempo be signaled by a ceremonial peal audible from the Starspan to the Citadel, giving citizens notice and witnesses time to watch. You include a requirement that the Archivist witness carry a portable plate that records the key’s touch each time it changes hands, so memory cannot be revised after the fact. You speak to Prior Asha beneath the arch and persuade her to lend a bell-brother to the board, promising that the slow-flow hours will ease the Loom without courting omen. You make it clear in your language that ceremony is not an excuse to sleep through danger, but a drumbeat that teaches the city to breathe together.",
            "outcome": "Maera reads the clause twice and exhales as if a sluice has opened, then signs, leaving a smear of oil like a thumbprint prayer to the machinery she loves. The Order applauds the provision of a bell-peal as public witness and sends Bellkeeper Dorn to stand with the plate on holy days, promising his ears will hear if the Loom teeters. Wardens grumble at the added ritual steps, but the board of three feels like a shield rather than a shackle, and their crews begin to speak of festival nights with relief instead of dread. Some merchants mutter that the peals will slow profit as well as water, yet the first trial night passes with lanterns bright and tempers low, and the city sleeps without a single emergency shout. Your brass leaf returns to the Scriptorium warm from hands that have agreed to share the touch of the key, and the witness-plates sing a soft, satisfied note when Iven weighs it."

            "text": "You sketch a panel with teeth, not ribbons—Sere Aven, a Moor peat-ward sworn neutral by salt-bowl, and a Collegium resonomancer whose stipend depends on accuracy rather than favor. You draft transparent tallies to be posted outside the Sunken Glassworks, listing nights when kilns will cool and days when fire runs high, so rumor cannot run faster than fact. You add clauses to prioritize fuel to bridge-seal pitch and grain-drying runs during famine weeks, with compensatory credit for the Guild when their sacrifice keeps bread from molding. You require surprise audits by Archivist novices paired with Rafter representatives, not to shame but to verify and praise where praise is due, because a city remembers fairness as long as it has witnesses. You promise Sere that rationing will not be a strangling cord but a woven sash: firm, visible, and even-handed across guilds.",
            "outcome": "Sere Aven taps the panel list with a shard-knife and nods, the edge of her mouth turning up when she reaches the clause about public tallies that pin gossip to dates. The peat-ward from the Moor smells of wet iron and dusts your leaf with a pinch of blue moth silk as a sign of blessing, while Magister Vell’s junior, Pika Jinn, agrees to sit the panel with a repertoire of calm numbers. The first cool night draws jeers from a few impatient buyers, but the next day’s glass rings clearer in the testing racks, and the Wardens find their pitch stores steadier than they have been in a lean year. The Embersleeve loses a little shadow in the Vaults as transparent schedules make smuggling less profitable, and Rafter crews share the posted tallies along towpaths where even skeptics can read them. When the brass leaf returns to the Scriptorium, Iven weighs it and remarks that sometimes mercy is simply a schedule written where everyone can see, and that is a strength, not a weakness."

            "title": "Grain Before Gold: The Emergency Passage Clause",
            "text": "You compose a clause that lays the city’s bread on the scales before anyone’s banners, fixing the emergency threshold to measurable signals: bell-markers at granaries, ration queues length, and the Moor-Sibyl’s peat deliveries diverted thrice in a fortnight. You bind the Wardens to open a grain window within twelve hours of that threshold, with the Rafter’s League to provide tow-crews on a rotating roster posted three days in advance. You add penalties for false alarms, payable in public service hours rather than coin, to train both sides to precision rather than bluster. You speak with Pellar Nine-Poles in the shadow of switch-rafts being lashed, promising that her patience will be praised by witnesses on the plates, not taken for weakness in the songs. You pen a sentence that forbids grandstanding closures by any house or guild during such windows, under pain of a public reading at the Drowned Theater where the city decides what story it believes.",
            "outcome": "Pellar’s laugh comes soft and proud, and she signs with a flourish that looks like a wave cresting over the letter of her name, then she sends a whistle-runner to spread the roster call. Captain Maera counts the measures you set and admits that thresholds she can read beat pleas she must interpret in the heat of a hungry crowd, and she adds her initials beside the twelve-hour promise. The first test comes faster than expected; granary bells chime and queues coil, and within the day a procession of grain barges slides through opened gates while rafters sing a working song instead of a war one. House banners lower out of habit and perhaps shame, and when a single noble tries to interpose with a ceremonial barge, the Theater’s balladeers turn the tale before nightfall into a comedy of errors no one wishes to repeat. Your clause becomes a story that people quote at stalls and on bridges, and the brass leaf returns to the Scriptorium smelling faintly of flour and river-wind."

            "text": "You frame the aqueduct right-of-way as a legacy fulfilled rather than a crown surrendered, praising House Thalen’s long spine of stone and the vision that lifted it from the valley like a road for water and feet alike. You set rail-heights and lantern-intervals in writing, the mundane math that keeps romance from becoming gravestones, and you require Collegium insurance to sit behind every public step like a quiet guardian. You promise the Wardens ward-poles and patrol intervals, not to police celebration but to keep gargoyles from waking to startle a child into an empty space. You add a festival proviso: on nights of full moon and city oath-renewals, House Thalen’s crest will be lit on the keystones, so pride can stand with the people instead of above them. You soften no edge of responsibility, but you make the shadow of liability into a mantle of honor worn in public view.",
            "outcome": "Orin Thalen reads with a jaw like set stone, and then a long breath unknots the years in his shoulders as the clauses transform burden into stewardship he can name and defend. He signs and seals, and sends word to the Drowned Theater that a new production will celebrate the first open-walk along the arches, with songs that teach children where to put their hands and how to watch for ward-poles. The Wardens post the poles and test the gargoyle perches with measured trickles, learning which mouths grumble when they taste clean flow, and the Collegium puts its coins where its chime-plates are. The first procession is cautious and bright, with lanterns winking like stars along a stone spine, and the murmurs that travel home that night are of marvel, not mishap. Your brass leaf clicks onto Iven’s scale with the sound of an old hinge oiled, and for once the plates feel lighter after a signature rather than heavier."
