    "description": "The Hall of the Unentombed breathes like a careful mourner, all cool stone, curtained alcoves, and the soft susurrus of whisper-wires carrying permitted grief. Professor Nyra Vale summons Rogan behind a veil of reed-silk and lays a bone sliver upon her palm; it ticks faintly in counterpoint to the Resonant Gate’s second, wrong note, as if Marrowhold keeps two heartbeats—one honest, one trained to lie sweetly. She speaks with ethics wrapped tight around worn resolve, yet a tremor in her throat betrays a scholar perched before a trespass she vowed never to make. In the Archive of Veins, a shelf of erased names has begun to murmur in the sleep of its shelving clerks, and the living indexer mutters of footprints that walked into the Night-Glass stacks and ended where a page is no longer. The city inks its memory into marrow so contracts, oaths, and love letters do not fade; if that memory is rewritten, the world inside the ribs becomes a theater run by a single hand. Tonight the Archive is closed to petitioners and thieves alike, but closures are for the polite and the cowardly when the dead begin to hum warnings through bone.",

            "lines": "Listen closely, Rogan Kettlebone, and you will hear the second heartbeat of the city hiding beneath the first; this bone fragment thrums in lockstep with the Resonant Gate’s wrong note like an unrepentant echo. We entrust our contracts, confessions, and consolations to marrow-ink because bone remembers what flesh forgets, but someone has taught a sliver to lie and that is a crime against the city’s dead. If the Archive of Veins can be made to forget, then oaths will sour, inheritances will slither, and the law itself will wear a borrowed face and answer to a stranger’s name. I swore, as all Unentombed do, to bind my desires beneath ethics, yet I would break before I allowed this to pass unchallenged while the shelves mutter in their sleep. Will you take your mirror-cut courage, your stubborn oath-keeping, and walk the quiet halls tonight for truth rather than indulgence?"

            "lines": "I’ve carried a Night-Glass page before, and when I blinked the letters rearranged like sand under a storm, settling into a shape that still visits my sleep; I learned then that paper can bite as hard as any blade. My palm knows mirrors and lies and what it costs to keep my own name upright in this city, and I’d rather bruise for truth than heal under a false oath. Tell me which aisle sings wrong and which name I must not speak aloud, and I’ll walk to it as if I were back on Watch with a lantern and a brace of rook whistles. I’m not built to steal for the Nameskeeper or burn for the Syndicate, but I can carry something heavy and bring it back in one piece. If there’s a bruise to be earned, I’ll wear it like a badge, and if there’s a page to be rescued, I’ll carry it and the ache that follows."

            "lines": "Find the living indexer and ask for its shadows and steps, but pay it with clean water, patience, and the courtesy due to a creature that knows the city’s footprints better than any watchman. It will whisper of cooled air where warmth should have pulsed, and it will point you toward the Night-Glass black stacks without speaking their name. Beware Sila Vane, for she can sell a lie that sounds like your own heart finally telling the truth, and she will smile while she locks the city to her ledger. Use your old tokens at the maintenance grate beneath the Archive’s eastern vein—my oath covers your trespass for this night only. Bring me a copy if you cannot reclaim the original, and leave fewer scars than you must, for every scratch on the Archive bleeds into our future."

The last feet to enter the black stacks walked on silence and carried a mirror beneath the left hand, weighing courage against convenience with every step. Air cooled where the fulgurite notes should have warmed the bones, and a page shifted itself between breaths like a fish rolling in shallow water, then it was gone and the footprints ended at a memory-sink. Drink, and let me drink with you, for I am thirsty in the way that only an index can be, parched for the payment of attention, patience, and a cup of water owed by the city I keep. If you listen to the floorboards, they will tell you which plank lies and which plank sings true, and if you respect my keeping, I will angle the lamplight away from the Watch and toward your shadow so that it does not grow too long."

            "lines": "You walk so loudly for a man who claims to love quiet truths, Rogan, and that hum in your pocket tells me you value rhythm as much as righteousness. You came to pluck a page as if it were a splinter from your skin, but pages have roots, and this one threads through bribes, tariffs, and a Triarch’s bruised conscience the way a reed threads water. The Nameskeeper would rather you bleed privately than rip the ledger and let a riot read it, yet even we know there are worse truths better buried beneath a tidy scandal. Help me expose a lesser rot—a petty embezzlement, a falsified tariff code—and I will help you make a copy that damns who you want without burning the city you pretend you don’t serve. Or refuse me and we will both learn how much noise your old Watch tokens make when they rattle against a slammed gate."

You sell comfort with the confidence of a priest and the charm of a storm-brewer, but I have bought my share of comforts and found the change paid back in ghosts and curfews. Give me a page that tells what it tells or stand aside while I make my copy, because I won’t trade a small truth for a big deceit just to keep friends with your mirrors. I’m not here to topple the ribs in one night; I’m here to set a single bone so it bears weight without snapping when the city leans. You choose whether to be plaster on the crack or a hand pushing the wall."

            "lines": "You never were convincing as a trespasser, Kettlebone, but you wore a Watch cloak long enough to know which way to turn your shoulders when a whistle blows. I see the edge of a sanctuary stamp, and I hear the pipes muttering like they do when the Gate starts to brood; that’s enough to make me remember that not all orders feel clean in the mouth. My lads are thirsty for promotion and quick arrests, but they’re not deaf to the way the city groans when we pull the wrong thread, so tonight I choose to be blind where the law would have me blink. Take the blue-lacquered stairs and mind the chipped step at the landing; it sings when you rush it and the echo carries to my laziest sergeant. If anyone asks, I spent this hour teaching rook dames to curse in three districts, and you were never more than a rumor with heavy boots."

We are not yet at the heartseed, but the path beneath our feet now runs in that direction whether we wanted it or not. I will secure this copy under the oathlights and mark three witnesses so it cannot be unwritten by the same hand that unwrote the original. The Unentombed will move quietly and quickly, because truth grows brittle if left too long in air. Walk carefully, Rogan, for the Syndicate’s mirrors will be looking for the shape of your shoulders before dawn."

If the Syndicate has curled glass fingers around the city’s bones, we’ll pry them loose one joint at a time and learn which rings squeal. I won’t promise a miracle, but I can promise work, and work is what keeps ribs upright when winds test the span. Call on me again when the shelves start muttering, and I’ll answer with boots and water enough to pay a debt. Tonight I’ll sleep with my shard under palm and listen for the Gate, and if it hums wrong, I’ll be back before the second note fades."

You do not demand, you ask, and you wait through the patient cadence of a keeper that has learned to be obeyed by being remembered. You place your palm flat on the floorboards and listen for the plank that lies, and the indexer hums when your hand finds it, pleased by your attention more than your coin. You speak to it as to a veteran of a long watch, thanking it for footsteps cataloged, and it repays the respect with shelf numbers, time marks, and a warning about a breath of cold that does not belong in a warm hall. When you rise, you are burdened only with knowledge and a path angled away from the Watch patrols, and the indexer’s wicks dim in contentment rather than suspicion.",
            "outcome": "The indexer reveals the precise shelf where the Night-Glass page vanished and the hour the air cooled, guiding you along lamplit aisles that throw your shadow where no watchman thinks to look. It also loosens a maintenance shutter with a sigh, giving you a quieter exit should things sour in the stacks. Your deference earns you a sliver of goodwill with the Archive staff and the Unentombed who tend them, and Nyra later notes, with approval, that you paid your debt in water and patience. The extra time spent listening, however, allows Sila Vane to arrive with her velvet words and a suggestion of partnership, forcing you to parley before you proceed. Even so, the Archive does not raise its voice against you, and the Watch cordon drifts a street away as if gently persuaded by the building’s own bones."

You name the lesser scandal she offers for what it is—a decoy breadcrumb—and you insist on the page you came for, not the one she would prefer to headline. When she reaches for the ledger shelf you step through her shadow and put your fulgurite blade under the book’s spine, not to cut but to warn that you will if forced. The air tightens with the scent of ember-sparks and mirror-oil, and for a heartbeat you see the reflection of yourself she would trap in her polished lies, a smaller man with softer edges. You step away from that vision and make your copy while she watches, and you leave her the original with the message that your fight is with the hand that pays her, not with the clerk who files the bill.",
            "outcome": "You secure a clean rubbing of the ledger page that implicates O.V. in the Gate’s corrupted harmonics, and you do it without letting Night-Glass rewrite the narrative into their favored scandal. Sila Vane’s eyes cool and she marks you in whatever ledger she keeps for men she must one day stop, trading charm for calculation as she lets you pass. The Night-Glass Brotherhood begins to set mirrors at angles that catch your movements in markets and along ribways, and rumors grow teeth in taverns where you once drank in peace. The Watch cordon, alerted by some small betrayal of silence, tightens just as you approach the exit, forcing you to face Serge Kobb with a choice between reputation and arrest. Serge, weighing sanctuary ink and his own fatigue with false orders, steps aside this time, but he tells you gently that next time you will need more than a priest’s handwriting to buy his blindness."

Your old Watch tokens kiss the maintenance grate with the intimacy of old lovers, and the lock, surprised, yields without complaint as if it had been waiting for your hand. You plant a decoy—a folded sheet that hums harmlessly—where a page should have been, and you take only a rubbing, singing the letters under your breath so they settle straight. When an echo-lantern threatens to flare and raise an alarm, you cup its glow with your oculus shard and teach it patience until the light learns to dim politely. You leave no wake but the heat your skin borrows from the Archive’s air, and even that you give back at the threshold with a slow exhale.",
            "outcome": "Your stealth is a success measured in silence and in the absence of pursuit; the rubbing you carry is crisp, and the original ledger remains where it lies, unknowingly guarded by your decoy. The living indexer, however, notices that you took without conversation and files your name under a ledger of small debts, not unpayable but remembered; future requests there may require more water and more waiting. The Watch cordon never truly coalesces around your exit route, and Serge Kobb hears only a rumor of your trespass until you are already down a rib and two markets away. Nyra Vale praises your light touch while reminding you that even gentle theft strains an Archive’s patience, and she sets a quiet intention to make a formal courtesy call to mend the bruise. Night-Glass, denied the thrill of a confrontation, spreads a whisper that you are a shadow who prefers back doors, and the rumor serves you as both cloak and bait."
