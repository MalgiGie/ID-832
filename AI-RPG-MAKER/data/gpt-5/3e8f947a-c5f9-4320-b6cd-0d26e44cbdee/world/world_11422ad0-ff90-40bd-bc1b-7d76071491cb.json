    "city": {
        "name": "Marrowhold",
        "epithet": "City in the Ribs",
        "location": "Nested within the calcified ribcage of a fallen sea-titan at the heart of the Saltglass Expanse",
        "geomorphology": "Arches of titanic bone rise overhead like pale avenues. Streets coil along rib-ledges and through marrow-hollows. Wind organs carved into vertebrae turn the constant desert gusts into low song. A natural canyon, the Spinewind, splits the city beneath, bridged by bone-and-glass spans. The sternum has been carved into a ceremonial gate that sings in storms.",
        "population": 143000,
        "demographics": "Humans (55%), ash-elves (11%), glassborn (12%), fen-dren (9%), ogre-blooded (6%), and others (7%) including itinerant skyfolk and caravan clans.",
        "government": "A precarious Triarchy: the Magistrate of Coin (currently Factor Orun Ves of the Saltglass Syndicate), the Prelate of the Hollow Sun (Lys Amon), and the Legate of the Watch (Tharn Corvell). In practice, guilds and cults control policy through leverage on water permits, skyship tariffs, and bonework licensing.",
        "economy": "Exports: saltglass panes, fulgurite blades, carved leviathan-bone, marrow-ink, fossil curios, whisper-reed tonics. Imports: timber, grain, iron, beasts of burden, and fresh fruit. Trade flows from caravan trails, skyships docking at Spinespan Aerie, and barge lines from Hearthmirror Lake.",
        "law_and_order": "The Watch of the Rib patrols ribways and markets, deputizing bone-constructs as shock units during unrest. The Night-Glass Brotherhood deals in secrets the Watch cannot legally touch. The Unentombed police necromancy through internal oaths; licensed rites only.",
        "religion": "The Order of the Hollow Sun venerates the veiled light said to have scorched the titan; rites involve mirrored reliquaries and bone lanterns. Ancestor cords are tied to rib-hooks in homes. Minor cults include the Wind's Teeth (storm-chanters) and the Last Current (mariners-in-exile).",
        "magic": "Resonant bonecraft binds runes into calcified strata to carry sound, memory, and force. Marrow-ink acts as a memory conduit when written on skin or vellum. Necromancy is a scholarly discipline restricted to post-mortem counsel and civic labor; true raising is illegal. Star-metal from the Barrows powers rare engines.",
        "military": "The Watch of the Rib fields 2,400 regulars and 600 reserve Aerie Lancers. The Bonewrights can animate thirty civic constructs in hours if threatened. Skyhooks on the Spinespan Aerie rig trawl-nets to down enemy gliders.",
        "infrastructure": "Wind-trap condensers feed the Marrowspring Cisterns. Echo-pipes burrow through bone to carry announcements citywide. Shade-canopies of woven reeds stretch between ribs to cut heat. The Resonant Gate channels storm-sound into the city’s alarm network.",
        "history": "Founded three centuries ago by exile caravans who sheltered in the titan’s ribs after the Glassfall Storm. The Gilding Age began when fulgurite techniques birthed the Saltglass Syndicate. A century ago, the Sunderspark War pitted the Bonewrights against a rogue necromantic cabal; the ribs split and the Under-Ribs collapsed in places. A tenuous peace has held since the Triarchy Accord, but every drought strains it.",
        "legends": "It is said the titan’s heartseed still turns slow beneath the sternum, warming the city in winter. Every ninety-ninth noon, the Resonant Gate hums a note only children and hounds hear—an omen of famine or fortune. A jawbone door in the Ossuary Palace opens for those who speak their true name forward and backward, revealing a hall of futures in fossil-amber.",
        "festivals": "Hollowing Day (midsun rites of reflection and bone-polishing), Spinewalk (night procession along rib-edges with mirror-lanterns), Glass Night (fulgurite lightning-calling with sky kites), Water Oath (new season permits blessed at the Cisterns), and the Quiet Thrum (citywide silence kept during the Gate’s long hum).",
