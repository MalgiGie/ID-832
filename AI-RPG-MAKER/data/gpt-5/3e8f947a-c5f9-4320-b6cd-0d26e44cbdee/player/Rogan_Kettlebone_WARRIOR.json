    "appearance": {
        "description": "Broad-shouldered and tall with ash-olive skin and heavy forearms, Rogan wears bone-lamellar over desert linens, a shade-veil rolled at the neck, and knee-high sand boots scored by glass. His hair is cropped short and threaded with rook feathers.",
        "distinctive_signs": "A fulgurite-burn lattice across the right shoulder from a Glass Night accident; marrow-ink oath cords etched along both biceps; a mirror-cut scar on the left palm in the shape of a broken oculus."

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Born in the Under-Ribs to a water porter and a scaffold rigger, Rogan grew up listening to the Resonant Gate hum through the echo-pipes and learned early that in Marrowhold, debts and droughts both come due. At sixteen he joined the Watch of the Rib and served as a ribway shock trooper during ration riots, coordinating with Bonewright constructs in the Iron Garden and escorting barge convoys from Hearthmirror Lake. During a storm-season drill at Spinespan Aerie he hauled a young signal pilot, Zexi Orr, back from a snapping mooring chain, earning a quiet life-debt from the Rookery. Years later, on a Whisper Fen escort, Rogan bargained a breath with Nyssar Fenquill to save heat-sick children, tying himself to a promise he still struggles to keep. After a curfew sweep went wrong near the Archive of Veins, Rogan was ordered to carry a Night-Glass black file to the clerk stacks; he saw enough to recognize the initials of a Triarch within and refused to purge the copy, leaving the Watch on 'extended leave' rather than lie under oath in the Temple of the Hollow Sun, where Isha Velroon sheltered him for a night under sanctuary. Now he works as an independent ribway guardian and caravan defender, moving between the Cage Market and Marrowspring, trying to hold a thin line while the Bonewrights and the Saltglass Syndicate pull the city in opposite directions.",

In the Whisper Fen he also broke the wording of a breath-bargain; the Fen Queen has not yet called in the cost, but Nyssar warned that when she does, it will be at sunset on a day of still water."
