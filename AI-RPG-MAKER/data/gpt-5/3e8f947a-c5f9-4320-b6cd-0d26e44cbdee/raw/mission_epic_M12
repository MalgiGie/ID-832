Reed-scent drifts from the Marrowspring clerks who have wetted the mirror floor, and above, the Hall of Mirrors dims the harsh sun into a halo that watches without blinking. The Resonant Gate’s low note rides the echo-pipes to every niche, a steady promise that what is sounded here will be carried to every rib-hung window and marrow-hollow stair. Factor Orun Ves sits poised as glass before anneal, the Prelate’s gaze tempered and bright, and Legate Tharn’s jaw muscles ticking like a counting wheel skipping teeth. Rogan Kettlebone stands where the floor remembers boot heels from the Sunderspark War, carrying a ledger page that stains the air with wrong music, a fulgurite shard that hums the guilt it once drank from lightning, a bone tablet etched with a tuning phrase older than his scars, and a heartseed sliver that has learned to wait. Outside, shade-cloths ripple over a hundred thousand faces, mirror-lanterns shiver with rumor, and the city in the ribs holds a breath that could end as a cheer or snap like a bone under sudden weight. This hour is a forge where words are the only irons allowed, and the hammer is a voice that refuses to wander, and the anvil is the city’s patience. If the chord is true, a Triarch may fall; if the chord is false, the ribs may ring with panic; if the chord is merely loud, it may drown the very mercy it claims to defend.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Present the ledger page naming Orun Ves to the Triarchs in the Hall of Mirrors.\",\n        \"Demonstrate the resonance proof using the fulgurite shard and cullet thread.\",\n        \"Propose a retuning of the Resonant Gate using the bone tablet and heartseed sliver.\",\n        \"Decide whether to demand Orun Ves’s removal, force a binding accord under public oath, or expose all and risk immediate unrest.\",\n        \"Sound the Gate’s corrected chord and coordinate with Watch, Bonewrights, and the Order to calm the city.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Matron Sere Kall\", \"lines\": \"Stand where the bone remembers, Rogan, and let the floor carry your stance into the marrow of those who would forget their debt to the city. I will hold the frame as I have held bridges in storms, but the span we cross today is woven of breath and belief, not stone and sinew. Speak in the measure of true instruments: bone for strength, glass for clarity, word for binding, and give no inch to rattling coins masquerading as authority. Remember that no iron may be drawn here, so you must cut with steadiness and patience, and your edge will be the truth all can hear. If your voice falters, lean upon the Gate’s long note and upon the names of those who thirsted while ledgers fattened; they will lend you courage without asking interest.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Orun Ves\", \"lines\": \"Weather comes and goes, Mr. Kettlebone, and clever men do not mistake a passing gust for a season turned. Rumor is a cheap wind, while ledgers are the mountains that teach it where to break, and I have charted these currents for longer than your scars have itched. Papers can be coaxed to sing false, and cullet can hum in any key if you warm it with the right furnace, so forgive me if I do not kneel at the altar of a single page and a pretty shard. The city has always loved a villain it can name because it lets the rest of us keep our little grifts and call them necessities, and perhaps that comfort is what you truly sell today. Choose your witnesses carefully, for the bone remembers every footstep, and you may discover that your echo pleases the mob in the square while offending the ribs that actually hold the sky above them.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rogan Kettlebone\", \"lines\": \"I grew up in the Under-Ribs where the Gate’s hum was lullaby and alarm both, and I learned early that debts and droughts both come due, no matter whose hand signs the permit. I carried water under sun that peeled skin and escorted barges through reed-mist where voices lied in the shapes of my loved ones, and I learned what truth costs when it is not convenient. You tuned our ribs to your profit, Factor, called it efficiency, and let the poor drink air while mirrors sang your virtue in the Temple’s oculus, and I did not forget the taste of that dust. I bring the page, yes, but I bring also a chord that does not bend around silver, a shard that remembers the storm before your tariffs named it theirs, and a sliver of patience from a heart that might yet warm this city without burning it. Today I choose witnesses with more eyes than your ledgers have lines, and they are called Marrowhold, and they are ready to hear a note that does not flatter the throat that sings it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Isha Velroon\", \"lines\": \"The dome hears everything spoken beneath it, and it leans most kindly toward those who have tasted hunger with the humble and still choose to share their bread. I have listened to the ink on that page with the reliquaries awake, and they shivered in a way that prayers do not soothe, for the note runs against the grain of the vows we bless. Mercy has a weight, yes, and it must sit in the same bowl as justice lest the scale crack, but mercy unguided by truth is only delay, and truth unlighted by mercy is a blade drawn in a house where iron is forbidden. We can bless an accord that keeps water unowned and oaths transparent, we can help the Watch hold ribways without using silence as a cudgel, and we can let the Bonewrights tend the strings so no purse can retune them in secret. If we do this, let us do it under the sun we revere, with mirrors turned not to blind but to brighten, and let us swear it where children can hear and remember.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Legate Tharn Corvell\", \"lines\": \"I have kept curfews with a bone whistle and the promise of a dawn that would still find our roofs overhead, and I have buried men who heard a different promise and did not live to test it. My officers can hold a line or bite their tongues, but not both if the square seethes and the echo-pipes spit contradiction, so give me clarity and I will give you quiet streets without the stink of fear. If you hand me a truth we can broadcast, I can set rook-kites to colors that calm, I can station constructs at bridges to be seen and not to strike, and I can walk ranks without feeling like I am lying to men whose pay I am already behind on. But if all you give me is spectacle and insinuation, then the first thrown bottle will write a law none of us wished to read, and the ribs will remember screams instead of a steady note. So tune your Gate, warrior, and give me a chord my Watch can march to without stepping on the city’s throat.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Prelate Lys Amon\", \"lines\": \"The Hollow Sun is a veiled light, and we are its keepers, not its owners, just as we must be keepers of the city’s thirst without folding our fingers around the cup. I have watched men use sanctity as a cloak for their appetites, and I have seen men spit upon sanctity because it did not match their appetites, and neither feeds a child. We must be precise: we will bless water oaths that are public and provable, we will renounce dominion over rations as a lever of politics, and we will call heresy only what seeks to unmake the city, not what seeks to mend it. If the Gate’s chord is retuned so its warning cannot be bought, then our mirrors will reflect that vow, and we will let the light judge us by whether we keep our word in drought as well as in rain. Speak, then, with the patience you carry in that sliver, and let us find a music that does not bend to any single hand, mine no more than yours.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Zexi Orr\", \"lines\": \"The signal kites are already in the air, Rogan, and the rookery watches the square like a second set of lungs ready to breathe or to hold breath on your sign. I remember the chain that sang my death and the hand that hauled me back, and I have never forgotten that rescue, so I will tune the sky to you if your chord proves steady. Give me a color and a sweep and I will paint the thermals with calm, turn the perches into a hymn that says wait and listen, and stall any hotheads in the Rookery who want to dazzle their way into legend by diving into a riot. But if the city hears only accusation without remedy, the rooks will carry panic from rib to rib faster than any runner, and I will not be able to keep them from it with memory alone. So make the sound clean, and I will throw our weight behind a landing as gentle as a rook’s foot on a favored wrist.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nyssar Fenquill\", \"lines\": \"Fen mist wraps a lie so gently you can mistake it for comfort until it steals your next breath, and city talk does the same when the words are sweet and the deeds are sour. I have heard reed hymns that make men walk into water, and I have brewed tonics that make them turn back and live, and I tell you now that your evidence is a bitter draught, but a needed one if thirst is to be honest. Promise nothing you cannot keep, for the Fen Queen bargains in the coin of unspent breath and she counts it at sunset when men think their day is done, and remember that the city has its own queen in every mother who waits with a bucket at the cistern. If you retune the Gate, let it sing for those women first, and let the tone match the measure of water they carry home, not the clink of cups in halls like this. Do that, and when the Fen hears the echo, we will answer with herbs and patience instead of rumors and withheld barges.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Demand Orun Ves’s Removal\", \"text\": \"You step forward into the mirror-lit hush and name the ledger’s initials aloud, letting the page sing its wrong note until even the reliquaries quiver. You name Factor Orun Ves as the triarch whose hand bent city policy into a noose around the thirsty, and you call for his removal by public vote of the council and oath-binding at the Temple. You lay the fulgurite shard upon the bone tablet, draw the cullet thread taut, and let the chord demonstrate how a single purse can pull the Gate’s alarms if left in reach. You look to the Watch, the Order, and the Bonewrights and bind them by their own pride, asking them whether they will continue to serve a ledge-walker who trades safety for tariffs. You end with a promise to the square outside that the ribs will not be rented any longer to a single guild’s ambition, and you hold the silence until it becomes assent.\", \"outcome\": \"The council, stung by the evidence and by the weight of eyes beyond the walls, votes to strip Orun Ves of his seat and to appoint an interim Magistrate of Coin, and the Prelate seals the decision with a water oath. The Watch deploys in visible, nonviolent lines under Tharn’s direct command, and the Bonewright constructs station themselves at bridge heads with palms open to reassure, not to strike. In the Ember Market, Syndicate loyalists hiss like quenching glass, and some furnaces dim in a petulant test of the city’s will, but the Aerie and the Caravan League move quickly to fill the gap and keep goods flowing. The corrected chord is sounded, and its tone carries across the ribs like an even breath after a sprint, tamping hot blood before it can boil and giving the square a song to cheer instead of a panic to hum. You earn the gratitude of common folk and the ire of those whose future profits had already been tallied in secret, and you leave the Hall of Mirrors with a title whispered along ribways and a target painted on your back in green-glass glint.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Forge a Binding Accord Under Public Oath\", \"text\": \"You lower the page but keep it within sight, and you speak not of heads rolling but of hands withdrawing from places they never should have reached. You propose an accord in which the Order blesses water without owning rations, the Watch secures ribways without gagging the square, the Bonewrights keep exclusive custody of the Gate’s strings, and the Syndicate steps back from the frame to grind its coin where it harms no one. You seat the fulgurite shard in a cradle of bone and let the heartseed sliver hum beneath it, demonstrating a retuning that cannot be pulled off true by any one guild’s purse or prayer. You call for the accord to be sworn in the open, under the oculus, with rope-singers and rook-kites signaling each clause to the crowd so no word can be hidden in shadow. You promise to sound the new chord immediately after, to show the city that vigilance can be kind and that compromise can be strong.\", \"outcome\": \"The Triarchs, cornered by truth yet wary of upheaval, accept the accord, and Prelate Lys Amon drafts a water oath whose phrases are as clear as glass and as strict as bone. Orun Ves, calculating the winds, steps back with a public bow and a private promise to test the new frame later, and the square relaxes into a murmur that tastes like rain after dust. The corrected chord is sounded, and it threads through echo-pipes and across shade-cloths, its calm timbre stealing the heat from clenched fists and redirecting it into applause and tearful laughter. The Watch takes positions that look like guardianship instead of occupation, the Bonewrights lock the tuning in a public ceremony, and the Rookery paints the sky with colors that mean breathe and listen. You gain esteem as a binder of oaths who kept the city from tearing a rib out of itself, while syndicate loyalists mark your name in ledgers not as an enemy to crush but as an obstacle to outlast, and you feel the city’s trust settle on your shoulders like a mantle that both warms and weighs.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Expose All and Let the City Judge\", \"text\": \"You cast the ledger’s name across the hall and then across the square by echo-pipe, refusing the comfort of council process and demanding the people’s verdict in the breath that follows. You lay out the evidence in relentless sequence, each note of cullet and shard and bone resonating in the Hall until even the mirrors seem to flinch at their own reflections. You speak of tariffs that bled water lines dry, of furnaces fed while infants fainted at the cisterns, and of a Gate tuned to a single guild’s fear and favor, and you ask the crowd whether this is the city they choose. You tell the Watch to stand aside unless blows are swung, you ask the Order to bless courage instead of silence, and you call the Bonewrights to guard the strings from every hand, including your own. You promise no quiet, only the clean burn of truth, and you let the air decide how hot that fire will run.\", \"outcome\": \"The square erupts with the roar of people who have kept their anger under shade for too many seasons, and not even the Gate’s corrected chord can pull all the heat from that first boil. The Watch moves to channel rather than crush, placing constructs where stampedes might start and opening routes that bleed the pressure into marches instead of riots, while Zexi’s kites draw eyes upward and slow the surge with colors that mean wait. Orun Ves retreats under escort to the Aerie, where his allies make frantic calculations against a wind that no longer answers their whistles, and in the Ember Market a handful of furnaces shutter themselves as apprentices drag masters away from rash speeches. The chord, once sounded, works like cool hands on a fevered brow, and by dusk the city sings a hoarse, aching hymn that is not quite joy but no longer rage, and the Hall of Mirrors stands without a crack sworn into it. You win devotion fierce as thirst from the gutters and suspicion hard as cullet from the galleries, and though the Triarchy staggers, it does not fall, leaving you with a reputation as a truth-bearer who does not fear mess and a future stitched with both gratitude and grudges.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M11\"], \"next\": []},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"title\", \"description\": \"Provisional Ribway Warden: informal authority to coordinate Watch, Bonewrights, and Rookery in emergencies.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"permit\", \"description\": \"Water Oath token granting ration discretion for Under-Ribs blocks during crises.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Citywide esteem among common folk; enmity from the Saltglass Syndicate faction loyalists.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
