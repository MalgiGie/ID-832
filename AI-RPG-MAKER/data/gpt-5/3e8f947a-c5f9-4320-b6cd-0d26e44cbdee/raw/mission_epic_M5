Apprentices move like careful notes through the forge-park, bearing quartz slivers from the Rift of Lumes to a bone frame strung in the old way, each slot a tuned promise that the city’s great Gate will sound true in storm and stillness alike. Matron Sere Kall stands at the heart of it, her hands stained with the calculus of weight and memory, and she declares that the retuning shall be done before witnesses and wind, not hidden in a tribunal footnote or a merchant ledger. The Saltglass Syndicate arrives with mirror-bright permits and men whose knuckles remember debt, Murne Glass-Eater among them, his smile polished to a tariff’s edge as he insists that profit is the only rhythm a city can dance to without falling. Overhead, rook kites flick question-sigils, bone lanterns blink with the faint breath of the Cisterns, and somewhere in the marrow of the Titan a subchord whispers the wrong note as if a storm far out in the glass sea plucked the city like an instrument. Rogan Kettlebone feels the Mirror-Oculus Shard in his palm answer with a sickly tremble, and he knows there is foreign resonance woven into the Gate’s bones, a cullet thread stitched where blank should lie. Between bone and glass stands Marrowhold, its bridges and bellies leaning on both crafts, and the day demands a steady hand, a truer tone, and witnesses whose signatures will hold like iron in a courtroom floor.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Hold the Iron Garden during the Bonewrights’ public retuning of the Resonant Gate: guard the ritual from interruption, keep apprentices steady beneath rising tempers, and protect Edda Tarn as she swaps in Rift quartz to straighten the note.\",\n        \"Mediate between the Bonewrights and the Saltglass Syndicate or choose a side when passion hardens to threat; identify the foreign cullet resonance woven into the Gate’s subchord, extract the thread without shattering the frame, and secure signed testimony from witnesses that the Gate was deliberately tampered with for profit.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Matron Sere Kall\", \"lines\": \"Bone remembers what it bears, and this city has leaned upon these ribs for three centuries with grief and grace alike. We tune the Gate in daylight so that every ear can judge whether the wind lies, and so that no ledger may later claim the song was private or convenient. Stand with us, Rogan Kettlebone, as a wall that does not move when coin shouts or when law pretends that ink is heavier than water. I do not ask you to draw your blade unless theirs gleams first, but I ask your presence to weigh the air toward honesty and away from theater. Today we set quartz into truth and truth into memory, and if anyone brings a false note to our door, we will hold it up to the sun until even mirrors stop reflecting it.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Edda Tarn\", \"lines\": \"I have listened to the Gate until sleep itself hummed wrong, and I hear a bubble in the throat of its song that should not exist if the frame were left alone. This shard from the Rift of Lumes carries a patient, even tone, and if I seat it gently, the hum will straighten like a spine released from a bad chair. If my hand slips, the frame will scream like bone caught in frost, and the Watch whistles will answer whether they are invited or not. I am not afraid of my work, but I am afraid of hands that jostle because they think a craftswoman is a lever they can pull to change a city’s vote. Guard my reach, Rogan, and I will make the Gate speak without guilt, and I will swear to what I hear in words that no court can shake.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Murne Glass-Eater\", \"lines\": \"You dress obstinacy in poetry, Matron, and you call it ethics when it is only control by another name. Mirrors make promises you can count and charge for, while old bone asks the whole city to tithe its faith to your guild’s quiet clauses. Let the Guild of Nine Weights lay glass-lined veins through these creaking ribs and the tune will be ours to keep steady, not a hymn to accidents and nostalgia. I have permits stamped with the Magistrate’s seal and laborers paid to lift what your apprentices drop; you can call them thugs, but they carry the city’s present, not its ashes. Refuse an accord, and you will discover that a market can storm louder than the sky, and that when it does, even your Gate will want for a place to anchor its song.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Veyla Prism\", \"lines\": \"Your frame is a harp that someone has dared to use as a loom, threading a cullet filament through a gap that should be blank as a newborn’s first sleep. The thread hums to a distant pulse, like a storm-anchor calling lightning by a name not spoken in this yard, and if left, it will bend every future tuning toward a profit’s convenience. I can pull it clean, because I was born to glass and I know how it sings when it wishes to be believed, but I will not be paid in coin that buys only today’s bread. My price is a promise of passage into the Expanse and the truth kept unshaded when the Syndicate’s mirrors begin to multiply stories. Agree, and I will draw out the false note like a splinter from a child’s heel, and I will place it in your warrior’s hand to keep as a witness that will gleam the same in lamplight and in court.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Rogan Kettlebone\", \"lines\": \"I have heard the Gate’s long hum since boyhood, and there is something in it now that speaks like a liar who has practiced, and I am tired of liars being hired as musicians. Murne, if your men step into Edda’s reach, I will step them back and set them aside, and I will do it with the gentleness of a storm that still leaves a roof standing. Apprentices, breathe with the count and trust your fingers; fear makes clumsy tools out of good hands. Veyla, if your price buys the city a truth and not merely my pride, then I will pay it with paths and protection, and I will sign my name to that debt. When this is done, there will be witnesses whose courage does not evaporate at sunset, and there will be a thread of glass that sings of guilt whether it lies on a judge’s bench or in the palm of a worker who has had enough.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Plant your feet with the Bonewrights\", \"text\": \"You step between the apprentices and the Syndicate’s advance as if your boots have grown roots into the Iron Garden’s packed dust. Your voice goes low and even, a ribway command that carries the weight of past storms, and you tell Murne’s men they will not cross the blue quench-lines while the shard is in Edda’s hand. You let the storm-skim sabre rest against your shoulder, not as a threat but as a promise that you will respond only to harm with harm, and you meet each pair of eyes until they look away. Behind you, you count time for Edda’s breath and for the apprentices’ hands, making the yard itself a heartbeat the city can lean on. You invite the onlookers to step forward as witnesses and to speak their names into your marrow-ink vambrace, binding their courage to paper that can sing its truth back when asked.\", \"outcome\": \"The Syndicate’s push breaks like a wave on ribs, shedding its foam into curses and retreating steps that still try to sound like strategy. Edda seats the Rift quartz with a sigh like a bone set right, and the Gate’s subchord relaxes until the wind itself seems to say thank you in the echo-pipes. Veyla kneels, flicks her wrist with a craftswoman’s contempt for ugly stitches, and teases the cullet filament free into a coiled, gleaming proof that hums at the edge of hearing. By the time Murne finds his tongue, six witnesses have etched names, trades, and words in your vambrace, each line a small oath that will not wash away in the Temple’s basin. The Iron Garden remembers that you held, Matron Sere Kall speaks her debt aloud before the crowd, and Veyla Prism, amused and impressed, offers her guidance into the Saltglass Expanse with the honesty of someone who has already measured your stride.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Broker a public accord on the anvil\", \"text\": \"You raise both hands and demand silence long enough for law, pride, and fear to hear themselves think, and you insist that any bargain be hammered under open sky. You compel Murne to read his permits aloud, clause by clause, while Matron Sere Kall answers in the language of load and maintenance, letting the crowd hear where ledgers lean on the city’s bones. You shape an agreement that lets the Bonewrights complete the tuning and secures a narrow corridor for mirror-lined trials under Conclave oversight, transforming threat into a scaffold for cooperation. You turn the onlookers into counters and witnesses, placing them on either side of the anvil, their presence a balance that keeps either party from tipping the table. You ask Veyla to extract the foreign thread as the price of peace, and you pledge, in front of all, to carry the proof and the sworn words to the Ossuary’s courts if any party breaks what has been forged today.\", \"outcome\": \"Murne’s men still grumble like coals under ash, but the permits lose their shine beneath the weight of public reading, and the crowd’s murmurs do not favor quiet tricks. Edda’s hands are steady beneath your shield of words, and the new quartz seats without protest; the yard’s tone settles as if a fever has broken. Veyla draws the cullet thread with surgical disdain, cradling it in saltcloth as it hums its guilt, and she hands it to you with a nod that seals her side of the bargain. Five witnesses sign onto marrow-ink lines that you dictate slowly, their statements naming the tampering and the truce, a ledger of truth that cannot later be rearranged without the city noticing. The Matron acknowledges a public debt to you, the Conclave’s craftspeople cheer without shame, and Veyla promises to guide you through the Expanse, saying that a map made in daylight is harder for thieves to steal.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Feign alliance with the Syndicate to get close to the wound\", \"text\": \"You lower your blade and tilt your voice toward Murne as if debt has finally bent your neck, letting him believe you are a man who knows where coin keeps roofs from leaking. You accept his permit with two fingers and read it with the care of someone seeking a way to obey without being a fool, all the while walking him nearer to the bone frame where the hum turns confession into vibration. You whisper about efficiency and tariffs and the appearance of control, and you let him see you nod at the right moments so that he spills more words than he planned to spend. You ask him, as a professional courtesy, to point out the line that authorizes the ‘stabilizing filament’ he has had woven into the Gate, couching the request in praise so delicate it passes for respect. You raise your Mirror-Oculus Shard as if only checking glare while Veyla slips, spider-silent, to the frame to tease the filament loose, her hands moving in the permission your theater has purchased.\", \"outcome\": \"Murne’s pride overreaches and he taps the precise clause you baited him toward, using a term of art that only a guilty contractor would know, and the onlookers hear it through the echo without needing a priest to translate. Veyla slides the cullet thread into your palm, and it hums like a rumor trying to hatch, a fragile coil that will sing the same regardless of who holds it. Edda swaps the Rift quartz under the noise of Murne’s sudden backpedaling, and when the tone settles, even his men hear the difference and look less sure of their wages. You pivot, lay the permit beside the testimonies you have already begun to collect, and invite three bystanders to sign what they just heard, capturing the moment like a beetle in clear glass. The Matron does not smile, but her voice is warm when she acknowledges a debt you can spend later, and Veyla Prism, amused by the con within the crowd, offers to guide you into the Expanse on the condition that you promise never to insult her with a clumsy lie.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Blow the old Watch whistle and bind the moment with law\", \"text\": \"You draw the bone whistle from your chain and let its tuned cry braid with the Iron Garden’s low song until Watch boots and curious citizens gather in a ring that says this is no longer a matter for corridors. You hold up your token chain and declare that this is a public rite and a potential crime scene, and that any interference will be recorded in marrow-ink and mirror both. You assign roles with the authority that never quite left your shoulders: two Watch to stand on either flank of Edda’s reach, two to keep Murne’s men from discovering enthusiasm, and the rest to circulate with your vambrace collecting sworn names. You ask the Temple’s nearest advocate-priest, if one stands within earshot, to observe without blessing and to remember that silence is not neutrality when a city’s bones are being tuned wrong on purpose. You nod to Veyla, giving her the stage that law has cleared, and you promise in front of the Watch that the cullet thread will pass from her hand to yours to the court without disappearing into anyone’s private archive.\", \"outcome\": \"The whistle’s authority cools hot faces, and the Syndicate realizes that boldness is cheaper than bail only until a crowd turns witness and the Watch writes it down. Edda’s shard finds its home, and the Gate’s hum drops into a true note that makes even the iron cacti seem to relax a fraction, their shadows lengthening in peace. Veyla extracts the filament and hands it to you with a flourish that tells the onlookers they have seen a trick undone rather than performed, and the thread’s uneasy music confirms the point. Watch quills scratch as five, then seven, then ten witnesses sign their names and trades, testimonies careful and plain so that no judge can excuse them as poetry. Matron Sere Kall speaks the Conclave’s public debt to you like a bell, the Watch nods grimly at your chain as if remembering the better parts of you, and Veyla Prism offers to guide you into the Saltglass Expanse, remarking that a city that keeps its records in daylight deserves a navigator who does the same.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"M4\"], \"next\": [\"M6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Cullet Thread: a coil of glass filament that still hums with the tuned frequency of the false note, incontrovertible key evidence that the Gate’s subchord was tampered for profit and a compass to the hand that plucked it.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"reputation\", \"description\": \"Public debt of thanks from Matron Sere Kall: the Conclave acknowledges your stand in open yard, granting you usable leverage with Bonewrights on permits, bridges, and construct aid when you next call.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"ally\", \"description\": \"Veyla Prism: the glassborn artisan agrees to guide you into the Saltglass Expanse, her eyes trained to hear light and her hands sure where dunes sing and wyrms dream.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
