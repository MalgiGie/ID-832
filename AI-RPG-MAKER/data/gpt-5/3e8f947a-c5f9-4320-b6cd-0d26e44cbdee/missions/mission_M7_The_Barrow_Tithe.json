    "description": "North where hills wear old impacts like medals, the Starfall Barrows open their cool throats to those who walk with respect. A petition written in light crawled along the Ossuary walls demanding a tithe from the city as if Marrowhold were a vassal under ancient, meteor-written law. Arakel Dorn of the Unentombed asks Rogan to carry diplomacy into a court where contracts are measured in memories and oaths taste like iron. Barrow shades, versed in statutes older than the ribs, line the walls like a jury, and an ash-elf advocate named Talekan Yss speaks for the dead with a careful rage. To secure star-metal needed for the Aerie’s safety and to learn whether the Gate’s hum has awakened old things beneath, Rogan must barter something he can afford to lose. The barrows will take a coin of memory without bleeding, but the cost is always counted later.",
    "objectives": [
        "Travel with Arakel Dorn to the Starfall Barrows under Unentombed sanction.",
        "Negotiate with Talekan Yss and the Barrow-Lord for a suspension of tithe in exchange for services.",
        "Offer a memory tithe (choose a memory) or find a legal precedent to satisfy the shades.",
        "Investigate a humming star-metal vein and compare its tone to the Gate’s false note.",
        "Secure a star-metal edge for the Aerie hooks and a writ easing Aerie access to Barrow materials."
