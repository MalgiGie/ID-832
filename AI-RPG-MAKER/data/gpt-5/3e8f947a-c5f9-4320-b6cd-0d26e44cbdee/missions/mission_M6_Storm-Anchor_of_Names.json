    "description": "The Saltglass Expanse hisses underfoot, a sea frozen mid-storm where dunes flash green-blue like scales on a sleeping wyrm. Veyla Prism ties her scarf against the glare and leads Rogan by the shadow of fulgurite spires that hum when a name is spoken too sharply. The storm-anchor—an old monolith forged by lightning and strange hands—shivers when the cullet thread is held near it, a tuning fork answered by a cathedral bell. Syndicate escorts skulk on mirrored ridges, and Pera Thass—notorious fixer with a smile like a polished shard—calls wind with practiced words. The anchor will bring a storm to the mouth of the Resonant Gate if the name ‘Marrowhold’ is spoken into it thrice in the right key, and the city will be tested by a fire dressed as rain. Rogan must sever the link, seize evidence, and leave before a glass wyrm remembers the last dream of a titan and surfaces to eat the instruments of men.",
