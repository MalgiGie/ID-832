    "description": "On the day of the Quiet Thrum, Marrowhold holds its breath, even the hawkers in the Cage Market mouthing prices without sound. The Resonant Gate’s low note stretches like a shadow across noon. In the Temple, Isha Velroon prepares a rite seldom performed, designed to cool a city’s temper while storms pass by a hair’s width from panic. Yet an Under-Sun hymn has spread in secret, and mirrors refuse to reflect those who sing it. Talekan Yss appears with a warning, and a splinter of the Under-Sun cult tries to thread their heresy into the rite, aiming to dim the Gate’s truth and amplify the false key. Beneath the floorboards lies a subsonic passage that opens to a chord only the careful and the faithful can play. Rogan must keep the rite intact, unmask the hymn, and retrieve a bone sliver that hums with the heartseed’s own slow turn.",
