    "description": "The Iron Garden breathes hot and steady, rows of iron cacti sweating quench-water while runes sing to resting constructs. Matron Sere Kall gathers apprentices around a bone frame strung like a harp, quartz from the Rift of Lumes glittering in slots meant for tone. She intends to retune the Resonant Gate in public daylight, a calculated act of faith and defiance, and asks Rogan to hold the line when tariffs and tempers boil. The Saltglass Syndicate arrives with polished permits and unpolished men, Murne Glass-Eater among them, arguing for mirror-lined bones and profit-shaped safety. Between bone and glass is a city that needs both to stand. Rogan must keep the ritual safe, choose compromise or confrontation, and carry away the proof that the wrong note was not an accident.",

        "Protect Edda Tarn while she swaps in Rift quartz to stabilize the note.",
        "Secure signed testimony from witnesses that the Gate was tampered with for profit."

Stand with us while we tune what others have teased into lying. I don’t need your sword unless they bring theirs, but I do need your back to be a wall my apprentices can work behind."
