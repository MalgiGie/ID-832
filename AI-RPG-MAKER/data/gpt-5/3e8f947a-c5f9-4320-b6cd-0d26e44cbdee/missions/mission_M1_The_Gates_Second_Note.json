    "description": "On a day without wind, the Resonant Gate gives a second, lower note that rattles cup rims and stirs old grief. In Marrowspring, the water counters skip teeth like a nervous jaw, and a fine smear of wet ash clings beneath the tally wheels, as if a storm passed through a whisper. Isha Velroon summons Rogan to the Temple of the Hollow Sun, where reliquaries tremble against their hooks and the mirror-oculus dims itself unbidden. Word travels faster than sand down a slope: some say the titan still breathes and wants to warn its city; others say the Gate is mis-tuned by greedy hands. Rogan feels his old Watch habits return—count, cordon, calm—yet the hum crawls under his marrow-ink and spells a name he can’t quite remember when he tries to say it aloud. This is how it begins: with a note, a skipped count, and a priest who trusts him to step where law and rumor trip each other.",

The Gate sang a second note last night, and my reliquaries thrummed as if something vast passed beneath them. Bring me truth that can be spoken aloud, and not just a fear that hides in a mirror."
