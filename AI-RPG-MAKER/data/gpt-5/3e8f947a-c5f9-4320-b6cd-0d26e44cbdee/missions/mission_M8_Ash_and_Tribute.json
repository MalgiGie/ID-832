    "description": "West in Cindervale, kilns breathe sparks like tired dragons and the orchards taste like smoke and sugar. Riala Hearthwake, a Caravan League quartermaster with sunburned patience, asks Rogan to walk into a negotiation that smells like scorched coin. Lady Ember-Thorn’s envoy, Bryx Thornbloom, arrives with a sealed brazier that must be lit or the treaty is forfeit; Factor Orun Ves has sent soft words and hard promises, offering tribute routed through the Syndicate to keep Watch budgets starved and tariffs sweet. The ash-road keeps Marrowhold fed and built, but every inducement is a hook bending toward a throat. Rogan must decide whether to prop the Watch with a deal Ember-Thorn can respect, expose the Syndicate’s scheme at the table, or turn the brazier cold and risk a border that burns.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Riala Hearthwake at the Caravan League waystation and review the tariff ledgers.",
        "Attend the parley with Bryx Thornbloom and assess Ember-Thorn’s conditions.",
        "Intercept a backchannel courier carrying Syndicate tribute terms to Bryx.",
        "Choose to support a leaner, honest tribute to preserve Watch budgets, expose the Syndicate and risk retaliation, or reject tribute entirely and prepare for raids.",
        "Escort the caravan safely back through ash squalls to Marrowhold."
