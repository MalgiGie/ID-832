    "description": "High along the spine, the sky smells of metal and dust, and the Spinespan Aerie creaks like an old ship at anchor. Zexi Orr’s rook returns with a mirrored eye that shows a city on fire not yet burning; she sends word in tight kite-codes begging Rogan to come fast and quiet. At the moorings, a great chain hums a counter-note to the Gate’s second tone, a tension like a throat trying not to cry. Pilots mutter about sabotage, and Watch lancers pace with hands on hook-lances, unsure whether to blame the Rookery or the Syndicate first. The Aerie is the city’s lifeline, and a snapped chain can take a skyship and a row of ribs with it. Rogan’s shoulder aches where old fulgurite burns spiderweb his skin, and he remembers pulling Zexi back from a chain that wanted to sing her name into thunder. This time, the chain is not singing a warning. It is singing to someone.",

The rook I sent came back with an eye that isn’t mine, reflecting a fire that hasn’t happened. If we don’t fix that chain and the song that works on it, the Aerie will be the first match."
