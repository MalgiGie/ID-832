    "description": "In a lanternless corner of the Archive of Veins, Sila Vane waits with a black mirror shard turned face-down like a guilty coin. She says the Nameskeeper is ready to sell the Syndicate a legend and a city along with it, unless someone steals back a page a second time and does it loudly enough that even Triarchs must pretend to be surprised. The Watch tightens cordons, and Serge Kobb walks his men like a man who keeps a bed rolled under his desk. Sila offers Rogan a ledger fragment that names ‘O.V.’ more openly if he protects her from both the Watch and the Syndicate during the swap. Every ally is a risk and every risk is a door into a room where the Gate’s hum grows louder. Tonight, proof will either find light or be burned out of the world and reborn as rumor.",
    "objectives": [
        "Meet Sila Vane at the Archive and agree on the terms of protection.",
        "Infiltrate the black file stacks and locate the Nameskeeper’s drop point.",
        "Evade or negotiate with Serge Kobb and his Watch unit without bloodshed.",
        "Secure the ledger page naming Orun Ves and escape via an echo-pipe service tunnel.",
        "Choose whether to give the page to Isha, Nyra, or keep a secret copy for leverage."
