    "description": "The Hall of the Unentombed smells of clean stone and whisper-oils, a place where grief is handled with measured hands. Professor Nyra Vale calls Rogan to a curtained alcove and produces a bone sliver that ticks faintly in time with the Gate’s second note. She speaks in the careful cadence of one taught to bind emotion in ethics, yet a tremor betrays a scholar staring over a boundary she swore never to cross. A shelf of erased names in the Archive of Veins has begun to murmur in sleep to its shelving clerks, and the living indexer remembers footprints of the last man who touched the Night-Glass stacks—footprints that end at a page no longer there. The city keeps its memory in marrow-ink; if someone is rewriting the song of what happened, every oath and tax and love swears to a lie. Rogan’s mirror-cut palm tightens around his shard. Tonight the Archive is closed, but doors do not stop a city’s defenders when the dead are beginning to hum.",
