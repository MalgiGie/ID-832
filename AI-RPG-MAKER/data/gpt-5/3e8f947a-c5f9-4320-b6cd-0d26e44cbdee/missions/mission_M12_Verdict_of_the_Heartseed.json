    "description": "The Ossuary Palace fills with a reed-scented hush, Triarchs seated among reliquaries that hum with a city’s history. Factor Orun Ves sits with the calm of a man who has never felt a hand close around his throat, Prelate Lys Amon’s eyes shine like tempered glass, and Legate Tharn Corvell’s jaw works as if chewing a word he hates. The Resonant Gate’s low note threads through the echo-pipes, steady and expectant. Rogan carries a ledger page that names the city’s betrayer, a fulgurite shard that sings his guilt, a bone tablet with a tuning phrase that can steady or shatter a reign, and a heartseed sliver that has learned his patience. Outside, the city waits under shade-cloths and mirror-lanterns, ready to cheer or break. This is the hour where a warrior’s blade is nothing, and a voice steadied by debts paid is everything. The verdict will either unseat a Triarch, bind a new accord, or tear ribs from sky.",

        "Decide whether to demand Orun Ves’s removal, force a binding accord under public oath, or expose all and risk immediate unrest.",
        "Sound the Gate’s corrected chord and coordinate with Watch, Bonewrights, and the Order to calm the city."
