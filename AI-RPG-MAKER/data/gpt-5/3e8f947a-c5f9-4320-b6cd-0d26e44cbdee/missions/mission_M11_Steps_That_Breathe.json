    "description": "The Sighing Steps climb the escarpment in a mile of carved breath, organ-pipes singing when the wind rises. Pilgrims carry bone-carved names and tired hope. The thousandth step lies to everyone, and the thousand-and-first tells a truth that hurts the mouth to speak. Talekan Yss asks Rogan to escort a procession and to listen close when the wind bends, because the Steps are breathing again and the lie they tell is the same: the Triarchy is already dead. Beneath a cracked tread, a harmonium cave shakes with a chord that fits the heartseed sliver like a key finding its lock. If Rogan can learn the Gate’s true name carved in the wind and marry it to the bone sliver’s patience, he can carry a verdict to the city that is not just rage but remedy.",
