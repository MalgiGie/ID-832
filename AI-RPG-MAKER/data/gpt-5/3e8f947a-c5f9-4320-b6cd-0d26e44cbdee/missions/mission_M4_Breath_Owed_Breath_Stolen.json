    "description": "The Whisper Fen gleams like an emerald spilled on a brass plate, mist clinging low as frogs sing like flutes with sore throats. Nyssar Fenquill meets Rogan at the reed edge, her eyes worried and kind, her hands stained green from medicines that save heat-sick children. A reed hymn has crossed the desert like a rumor of rain and taken voices as toll, including that of a Triarch’s envoy whose silence now chokes trade. The Fen Queen bargains in breath; Rogan once broke the wording of that bargain to save lives. The reeds remember debts, and the Fen keeps sunset like a knife in a sleeve. To heal what’s stolen, Rogan must walk channels where lanterns pretend to be friends and negotiate with a monarch who counts promises the way the city counts water. He came to repay a debt. He may leave owning another.",
