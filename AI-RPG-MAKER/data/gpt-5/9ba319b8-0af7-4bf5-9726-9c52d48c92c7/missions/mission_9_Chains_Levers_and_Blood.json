    "description": "The Parliament’s light blazed and then dimmed; outside, ropes and voices tangle. Ratchet Syndicate crews move to seize Dry Dock Three and, through a smuggler’s chute, the bypass tunnel beneath the Tide-Gate Crown. Sel Corvane presses a brass lever-rod into Raithe’s hand and names him auxiliary for a single night. Yarik Nine-Fingers comes, not with subtlety but with a simple proposition: turn the gate to prove the Guild’s tyranny, let the city see who really holds the hinge. The ring streets flood and empty with a dangerous rhythm as the Saltwardens split loyalties. In the lever-room, the humming tooth sings like a struck bowl.",
