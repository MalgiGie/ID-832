    "description": "A strange stillness haunts Skyhook Cliffs, where cables hum and kites claw the air. The Brass Aerie Collegium suspects illegal net-engines are siphoning wind to sell quiet in the market of fear. Dean Orrix Vant, whose respect Raithe earned in a gale that wanted silence, sends him to climb gantries and inspect gusts written by song. Hooklings—cliff urchins—whistle warnings in a code of their own, and wind-oracles squint at the lines like harp strings. The air itself bears the scratch of a thief’s hand. Ratchet hardliners and Tidewright apprentices trade blame in the cliff markets below as glider skins hang like flags of truce.",

        "Ascend the Skyhook gantries and use the Windglass Visor to trace where wind has been written and stolen.",

        "Rescue a trapped Aerie apprentice who fell into a siphoned calm pocket.",
        "Recover proof of who commissioned the net-engines: invoices, marks, or signatures."

Someone is stealing the commas—the pauses that let storms inhale—and selling them as safety. That is a vulgarity I cannot tolerate. Climb, Calder, and read the wind for me. Your visor will show you where fingers scratched at its skin."
