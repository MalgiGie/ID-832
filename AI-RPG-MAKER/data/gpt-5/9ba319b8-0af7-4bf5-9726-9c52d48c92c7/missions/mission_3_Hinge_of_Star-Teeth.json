    "description": "Arch-Wright Sel Corvane of the Guild of Tidewrights summons Raithe to the Tide-Gate Crown. Brass teeth and sky-silk curtains glimmer as crews hum chain-songs and salt mist settles on every tool. Rumors of sabotage and illegal gear-teeth circulate; the young masters whisper about a humming cog whose tooth bears a shard brighter than lantern flame. Sel wants certainty: the lever-room must hold against strikes and storm, and no myth must loosen his monopoly. The bypass tunnel beneath the crown runs cold and narrow, flanked by eelglass slick as winter. Raithe recognizes a smell he has tried to forget—the smell of the crate he once carried in that dark.",

        "Mark, but do not remove, any illicit gear and record its resonance using the Mnemos Leaf.",

Find out what has been married to my Crown and who performed the rite, and I will pay you in more than coin. I will pay you in protection."

We turn what turns us, and if a new tooth sings sweeter, why shouldn’t the docks have its hymn? Don’t get in the way of a better future because you’re scared of a little tune."

I’ll see what the heart looks like and I’ll write down its song, but I won’t let anyone tear at the gate while the tide is running."
