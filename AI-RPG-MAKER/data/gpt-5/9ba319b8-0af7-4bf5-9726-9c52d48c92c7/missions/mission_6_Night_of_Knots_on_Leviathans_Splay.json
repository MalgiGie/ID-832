    "description": "At the lowest ebb the city’s mudflats open like the ribs of a sleeping god. Star-Prior Alion Mareth petitions Raithe to escort the Tidebound Conclave during the rare Night of Knots, when vows are tied on exposed bone to renew the city’s covenant. Choirs hum countercurrents while white crabs gather, attracted to song. Lady Maris Veyron’s retainers come with incense and old claims, seeking to bind hereditary rights to the ribs. The bone bridge’s omens flicker, and a bell that should be silent answers the hymn. The hum in Raithe’s earring meets the Gate Crown’s hidden tooth across mud and distance, and for a dreadful moment, the city’s inhale and exhale fall out of step.",

But something hums beneath us that is not ours to command, and I smell brass on the tide. Stand at our side, Raithe, and if old claims try to ride our rite, cut their reins."
