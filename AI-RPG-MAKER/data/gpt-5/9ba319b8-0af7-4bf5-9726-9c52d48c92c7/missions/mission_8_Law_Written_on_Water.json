    "description": "Low tide draws the silt from the Glass Parliament’s floor, revealing the etched annuli of law and precedent. Nella Shuck of the Free Wharfers assembles petitioners at the steps, while the Saltwardens brace for unrest. Brask Ilyne and the merchants count the cost of chaos. Raithe must carry the Ember Page into the hall, keep the benches from breaking into riot, and hold the space for a Mnemos rite that will replay the Whisperfen’s borrowed night. The fissure filled with luminous grout glows when oaths go false; it may blaze with the brightness of a noonday storm. House Veyron’s advocates sharpen courtesy like knives. The city holds its breath; if the breath is released, it might be a sigh of relief—or a gasp before drowning.",

        "Hold the floor while Abbatess Serene conducts a recall, protecting Keth Borrowed-Tongue as witness.",
        "Expose the bribed clerk siphoning days from the tithe vaults without letting the hall dissolve into violence."
