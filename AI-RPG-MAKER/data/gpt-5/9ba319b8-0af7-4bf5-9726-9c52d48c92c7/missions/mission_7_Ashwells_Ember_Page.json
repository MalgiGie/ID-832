    "description": "The Ashwell Monastery lies in char and ivy, where gutters lead to a dry cistern painted with stars. It is said a well of names sleeps there; those who drop their true name may be forgotten by their hunters, but the future must be bought back page by page. Serene Khel sends Raithe with Tallen Quill to recover a page that remembers the city’s original flood treaty—a page which could unravel House Veyron’s new claims if read at the right tide. Ink wraiths copy footsteps in dust; ash-moths gather on the visor’s edge. In the cistern’s hollow, a gentle archivist spirit bargains with stories never told aloud. Raithe must resist the temptation to drop his true name into the well for a clean escape. The page glows when held near betrayal.",

Tell me a story you have never given to ink or ear, and I will let a page walk with you again. Drop your true name, and I will forget your hunters and your lovers, and you will walk light as ash—and empty as it, too."
