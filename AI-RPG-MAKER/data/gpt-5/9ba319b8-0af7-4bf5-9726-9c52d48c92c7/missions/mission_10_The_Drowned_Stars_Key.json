    "description": "The Basilica’s submerged chamber opens only for a song known to three priors. After the Night of Knots, Alion believes the drowned saint’s key must be married to the Gate’s hum to prevent catastrophe. He and Serene Khel invite Raithe to descend, ankle-deep in tidewater, into a lacquered blue darkness. Mirror-mosaic reflects a lantern starfield; ribs of stone curve like a whale’s mouth. Below the altar, the shard sleeps. Lady Maris Veyron’s presence hangs like perfume—she has learned of this descent and will arrive with pious entitlement and knives of courtesy. Within the chamber, the starshard answers when Raithe’s bone-chime hums, the key in his ribs matching the altar’s pitch. Some truths cannot be buried without the mud remembering.",
