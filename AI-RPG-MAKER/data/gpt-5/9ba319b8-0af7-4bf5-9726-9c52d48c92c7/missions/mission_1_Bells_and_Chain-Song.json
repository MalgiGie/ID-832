    "description": "Low tide exposes the letters of law on the Glass Parliament’s floor-script, and the chain-song of the Tide-Gate Crown sets the city's breath. Abbatess Serene Khel summons Raithe Calder to the Hall of Winter Ledgers for a discreet escort across ring three to the Basilica of the Drowned Star. A sealed recollection must be verified at the altar while the tide kisses the stone. Serene speaks of debts old as the city—of shards that hum when choirs sing and cogs that answer as if they remember stormlight. As bells toll, Raithe feels his bone-chime earring vibrate to a bell no hand rings. The air tastes of eel oil and salt ink; a Mnemos novice clutches a memory case like a reliquary. In the Basilica’s mirror-mosaic glow, the hymn climbs, and in Raithe’s ribs the hidden scar-map seems to ache. Iria Venn, his friend in Cartel blues, waits outside with a pilot’s impatience and a warning about fog and false light. All threads tug toward the same knot: the city breathes, but who holds its lungs?",

Walk with me as memory crosses stone to meet the sea. There is a song the city has begun to hum beneath the obvious hymns, and I would have a loyal shoulder nearby when we listen for its truth."

If a bell no hand rings answers tonight’s hymn, I need to know whether to steer them home or hold them in the black-toothed channel. Tell me the truth, not the pretty version."

If the hum is what I suspect, then law itself has a pulse we did not account for when we swore the first covenants. Walk softly, both of you. The city listens when the choir sings names that were drowned to keep them safe."
