    "description": "The Whisperfen upriver drinks sound and memory. Serene tasks Raithe to accompany Tallen Quill, a vow-scribe with ink that glows when truth is near, to meet the ferryman Keth Borrowed-Tongue. House Veyron’s marriage oath is whispered to be altered—its true clause might still float in the marsh’s borrowed voices. The river narrows and the reeds begin to listen; bog-lights mimic lantern codes, trying to lure skiffs into drinking pools. Keth poles a narrow boat through blackwater, speaking only in other people’s words, while white egrets stitch pale threads across the sky. The marsh remembers many nights; Raithe must persuade it to replay the right one without it swallowing his own past in payment.",

Mind your hands, they will be bitten by the past if they hang over the gunwales.’ That is what the last ferryman said, and I keep his words. ‘You are searching for a night that changed a house and a city; the fen drank it gladly.’ But you must promise it something it cannot spit back to you, or it will ask for your very first lullaby."
