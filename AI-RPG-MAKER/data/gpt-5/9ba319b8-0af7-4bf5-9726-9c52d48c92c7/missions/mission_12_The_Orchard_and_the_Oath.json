    "description": "With the city steady, final work remains: fix the law so it cannot be rewritten in a fog. The Glass Parliament commissions a new root-glass seal from the Glass Orchard’s fulgurite trunks to prevent future forgeries of city charters and to bind the tri-council’s shard protocol. The orchard chimes in a wind like crystal rain; mirror-larks mimic footsteps; cuts can bleed memory. A veiled penitent shows the path to a root where lovers once carved an impossible promise. Tallen Quill asks Raithe to stand guard as the seal is coaxed from the earth and carried back through the city, across the Leviathan Bone Bridge where omens will bless or curse the work. In the Parliament at low tide, the luminous grout glows, and the seal is pressed into wet law. Raithe hears in the chain-song a small change: the city breathes easier.",
