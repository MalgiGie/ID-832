    "description": "All factions surge like a spring storm. The Lantern Cartel’s convoys stack at the mouth; the Brass Aerie threatens a stillness over the harbor to force negotiations; House Veyron drums up a festival of gratitude that smells like a coup; Ratchet hardliners itch to test a lever; the Saltwardens tally where to put their skiffs. Iria Venn doesn’t speak for a guild when she finds Raithe on a parapet of the Tide-Gate Crown; she speaks for hulls and crews and friends who cannot wait out a political opera. The shard in the Crown must breathe in time with the shard in the Basilica, or the city will cough itself into flood and famine. The bells must ring a new code, the wind must bow but not kneel, and the tide-gates must learn a song they were never designed to hear. Tonight, the city inhales and exhales by your hand and the trust you weave between enemies.",
    "objectives": [
        "Broker a truce on the Gate Crown between Guild of Tidewrights, Tidebound Conclave, and Lantern Cartel using the joint writ.",
        "Coordinate with Orrix Vant to allow a controlled gust, not a stillness, over the harbor.",
        "Ring a new bell-code so Cartel pilots can time their entry with the shard’s safe window.",
        "Expose the bribed Saltwarden captain tied to sabotage at Dry Dock Three and remove his skiffs from the chain of command without sparking mutiny."

Sel, you hold the hinge steady when the shards hum together. Anyone tries to pull a stunt, they answer to my blade and to thirty thousand people’s patience snapping at once."
