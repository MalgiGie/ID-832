    "city": "Vyraleth, the Ringed Estuary, is a tide-girdled metropolis raised upon seven concentric causeways of basalt and leviathan bone where the River Vyra exhales into the Sablemere. Its streets drown and reappear with the regulated pulse of three vast tide-gates, and every watch is counted by bells and chain-song as the city inhales and exhales the sea. Founded 612 years ago by exiled salt-princes from the Dune Marches and memory-keeping monks fleeing a burning library, Vyraleth fused salt, glass, and mnemonic covenant into a singular economy. The Guild of Tidewrights engineered the ring system, granting ring-rights to households: inner rings buy safety from flood and levy rents and duties upon the outer rings, whose people live by wit and weather. Beneath the harbor mud, fishers swear they feel the slumbering ribs of an elder leviathan; when the fog called the Pale creeps upriver, locals forbid whistling, lest it wake the bone. Market days smell of brine, eel oil, and ash from the glass kilns; at low tide the floor-script of the Glass Parliament becomes legible and law is argued upon its shining letters, while at high tide choristers in the Basilica of the Drowned Star sing to saints whose names were drowned to keep them safe. Vyraleth’s dependencies are braided: upstream grain for coastal salt; sky-silk and wind-levies from the Aerie of Brass; beacons maintained by the Lantern Cartel for ships threading the Sablemere’s black teeth. Memories themselves are tithed: binding contracts must be deposited with the Order of Mnemos, who can reproduce an event for a fee measured in coin and days of remembered life. Legends whisper of a pact sealed with a fallen Drowned Star whose fragment lies beneath the basilica, and of a rival fragment hidden within a tide-gate’s heart. Politics surge like tides: House Veyron seeks to restore hereditary salt-tithes, the Ratchet Syndicate contests drydock control, Free Wharfers agitate to end mooring dues, and the Tidewrights defend their monopoly over flood and flow. Vyraleth survives by constant negotiation between flood and stone, between old blood and guild charters, and between what is remembered and what is conveniently forgotten.",
