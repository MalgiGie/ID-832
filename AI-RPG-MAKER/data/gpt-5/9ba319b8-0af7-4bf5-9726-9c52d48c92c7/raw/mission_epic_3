Chain-songs rise from crews moving along the parapets, and sky-silk curtains ripple with the sea’s pulse, gleaming like the throats of fish beneath lantern flame. The basalt underfoot sweats a salt haze, and the brass teeth of the gears below glow dully as if they dream of lightning. Rumors scuttle along the railings like hooklings: of sabotage maps chalked under benches, of illicit gear-teeth hidden in crates, and of a humming heart-cog whose single bright tooth is married to a star-fragment brighter than any pilot lantern. The bypass tunnel yawns cold and narrow beneath the Crown, its eelglass walls slick as winter spilled down a stair, and from its dark comes the ghost of a smell Raithe has tried to forget, sharp and clean and wrong like a surgeon’s kit wrapped in prayer-rags. He feels the bone-chime in his ear hum to an unheard bell, and in that tremor is the memory of a crate he carried through that same dark, the night he traded three days of youth to the Order of Mnemos so the city would not remember what his hands had done. Today he is to enter again with an old Mnemos map, to find the heart-cog and read its truth, to mark but not unmake, and to keep the hinge answering true to pressure while the city inhales and exhales the sea.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Enter the bypass tunnel under the Tide-Gate Crown using an old Mnemos map.\",\n        \"Locate the heart-cog assembly and determine whether a starshard is set into one tooth.\",\n        \"Mark, but do not remove, any illicit gear and record its resonance using the Mnemos Leaf.\",\n        \"Evade or confront a Ratchet Syndicate scout crew attempting to plant chain-snares near the lever-room.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sel Corvane\", \"lines\": \"We hold the hinge, Calder, and a hinge is nothing if it does not answer true to pressure, to storm, and to the foolishness of men who think tide-law bends to their convenience. My Crown has begun to sing measures I did not compose, notes that taste of metal and myth, and I will not share such intimacies with unseen hands. Rumor names a tooth set with a fallen piece of the Drowned Star, and though I do not bow to rumor, I respect the damage it can do when it finds purchase in iron. Go below by the bypass, follow the old Mnemos map, and look upon my heart-cog with a witness’s eye, not a thief’s. Bring me a mark and a measure and keep your hands off the tooth, for there are laws older than Parliament and older than guild charters sleeping beneath our mud, and I would not wake them because some dock-rat fancied himself a chorister of the deep.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yarik Nine-Fingers\", \"lines\": \"Funny sight, you watching the Guild’s jewelry like a love-drunk gull, Raithe, when I first saw you carrying a ‘medicine’ crate through these wet bowels and trying not to think about the way it rang. We turn what turns us, you know that better than most, and if a new tooth sings truer or sweeter, the docks deserve the hymn before the inner rings hoard the chorus. The Crown’s been choking our wages and calling it safety, and one bright shard biting brass might be the only leverage we ever get on the lever-room. I’ve got chain-snares that bite quiet and let the lever stutter just enough to win us a hearing without drowning anyone, and I’d rather your hand lay the snares than some boy who can’t tell tide from trick. Don’t get in the way because you’re spooked by a song; get in the way of the people choking our wind and water, and help me turn this city by the place it thinks is unturnable.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iria Venn\", \"lines\": \"There you are on the parapet, Raithe, with the wind in your hair and the gate breathing under your boots, and the Cartel’s bells all pretending they don’t know your tread by heart. I ran a fog lane past the Spires last watch and heard a bell no hand rings, and I thought of you because your bone-chime hums to the same sadness when the Pale creeps in. The Beacon Circle is nervous about whispers of a starshard tooth; they pretend they are not, but their pilots are reading the tides like auguries of divorce, and they will hate whoever proves the rumor true or false. If you go into that bypass tunnel, go with a promise tied so tight you can taste the knot, and remember the Cartel’s light-codes have been mimicked of late by people who want the city to miss its way by a hair. I will not ask you to choose me over your vows, but if you feel the gate change its breath, look back toward my lantern once and let me know the city is still ours to pilot.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Serene Khel\", \"lines\": \"Take the Mnemos map, Raithe, and take it not as a treasure to be kept but as a lantern to be returned, for memory is a commons and a covenant and not your private rope to coil. Your leaf of ember-ink will remember what you press upon it, but do not ask it to carry more than a single truth, or the leaf will smolder and take a day of your life as tinder. You must mark without meddling, witness without worship, and bind the resonance of any illicit gear in words precise enough that a court could taste them for truth. If there is a shard in that tooth, do not address it, do not sing to it, and do not let it sing to you, for the city’s pacts with stars were forged in fear and love and both are bad advisors in metal rooms. Return to me after with what you have kept, and I will see it is recorded cleanly, for the Mnemos do not sell the days you tithed and I will not let anyone buy this night’s sight out of your head.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Raithe Calder\", \"lines\": \"I’ve stood in crowds that were about to break and felt the crack come up through my shins before a single shove, and tonight the Crown feels like that, humming with a choice that wants to be made for us. If the tooth is bright with a shard, I will not be the one to pull it, nor will I be the one to pretend it isn’t there while men drown outside the rings. I will mark what must be marked, and I will write the song I hear on the leaf you gave me, Serene, and I will make the chalk speak where the metal hides its strain, Sel. Yarik, I’ve hauled too many bodies up out of black water to love your snares, but I know a stutter the city needs from a sabotage the city cannot survive, and I will not mistake one for the other. If the gate must breathe tonight, it will breathe with both lungs, and I will stand where the air is thinnest until it does.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Hold the Hinge for the Guild\", \"text\": \"You descend into the bypass tunnel with the Mnemos map folded in your palm like a cooled coal, and you move with a gatewright’s patience rather than a raider’s haste. The eelglass sweats and murmurs, and when you reach the heart-cog you study it the way you were taught to study a riot, by reading where the pressure wants to flow before it moves. You find the tooth that hums brighter than the others and you do not touch, but you hold the Mnemos Leaf to the music and let the ember-ink drink a single, faithful note until the leaf warms your blood through your fingertips. You draw the Guild chalk along struts and flanges and reveal fine stress lines like frost, marking each with a tally-mark and a vow-whisper so the metal knows it has been seen by a friendly eye. When the Ratchet scout crew crawls toward the lever-room with their chain-snares bundled like sleeping snakes, you intercept them with quiet words and a hard stance, refusing the compromise that would wound the gate, and turn them back with the promise that their grievance will walk upstairs on your tongue tonight and not be forgotten in the morning.\", \"outcome\": \"Sel Corvane receives your measured report and the chalked testimony of the Crown’s bones, and his relief is a cold tide that does not smile but pays. He equips you with a gatewright’s pass, stamps your temporary deputation with brisk fingers, and lets it be known to the Saltwardens that you are to be obeyed on the ramparts when bells go wild. The Ratchet Syndicate marks you cautious rather than craven, for you did not break their wrists to halt their snares, and some among them wonder if you could be a bridge when bridges are scarce. Iria hears through Cartel murmurs that you held the hinge true, and while she does not thank you with words, a single sweep of her lantern during a fogged watch spells a code the two of you learned as children that means: I saw you. The city breathes without stutter this tide, the lever-room remains intact, and your name is entered in a tidy hand in the Guild’s ledger of auxiliaries for emergency call-up—an honor that feels like a shackle only if you forget you asked for it.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Turn the Ratchet in the Dark\", \"text\": \"You meet Yarik’s look in the narrow light and remember a hundred dock dawns when the inner rings feasted on safety while the outer rings ate weather, and your anger directs your feet. In the bypass tunnel you record the heart-cog’s strange hymn with the Mnemos Leaf, but you turn the leaf just so to smudge the resonance, making a close truth into an ambiguous one that will withstand questioning but not invite repair. You chalk the stress lines where any fool can see them, but you dust the chalk from a key seam so the lever will catch in a single place at a single pressure, a stutter only a mechanic would love. When the scout crew slides their chain-snares into sleeping positions, you help pass the iron; you do not tie the knots, but you steady the coils and you whisper the timing for when the tide’s pull will mask the first drag. You leave the lever-room with your heart tight as a nut, knowing you have not broken the hinge but have taught it to complain in public, and the complaint will sing on the Parliament steps with a voice employers cannot ignore.\", \"outcome\": \"The morning’s tide brings a staccato hiccup to the Crown that forces a partial closure just long enough to snarl the Parliament’s schedule, and the Free Wharfers’ petition bleeds into the noon session like dye into water. Sel Corvane receives your report and hears the truth in it that is not the whole, and his eyes say audit while his mouth says payment, but the coin is counted with a colder hand and the pass he gives you comes with a warning about being seen in certain yards. Yarik Nine-Fingers clasps your forearm until bones remember their name, offering a quiet berth in Dry Dock Three and a whisper that when the Chain Circle votes, your name will be spoken with respect. Saltwardens mutter that you were seen near men with snares, and some start looking for you first when bells ring at odd hours, which is both protection and peril in a city of favors. The hinge holds, the city inhales and exhales, and yet a rumor begins that the Crown can be made to clear its throat for the poor, and with that rumor come opportunities that bite and kiss in equal measure.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Bind the Memory, Not the Gear\", \"text\": \"You take Serene Khel’s counsel into your breath and choose the path that neither flatters the Guild nor indulges the Syndicate, and in that middle you find a sharper edge than either expects. In the bypass tunnel you witness the heart-cog’s tooth with the attention you wish someone had once given your own scars, and you capture the resonance perfectly upon the Mnemos Leaf, wincing as a tug at the back of your eyes suggests the city would buy more if it could. You chalk every stress line and then you chalk the chalkings, making a map that can be read without you, because a true record must be survivable. When the scout crew creeps like cats toward the lever-room you do not threaten or soothe; you offer them passage if they will only tie their snares in the open where the Saltwardens can debate the knots with them, and the absurdity of it derails them long enough for the tide to turn their window to a wall. You leave with the gear untouched, the Ratchets unsatisfied, the Guild uncertain, and a sealed packet for the Abbatess that will turn a private rumor into a public memory subject to law instead of leverage.\", \"outcome\": \"Serene Khel receives the leaf in the quiet of the Hall of Winter Ledgers and binds your recorded resonance under black-ink that glows when truths are bent, and she whispers prayers not to saints but to procedures older than saints. A copy of your witnessing is deposited against a Parliament seal for a hearing at low tide, and already the schedule-committee feels the Lantern Cartel’s breath on its neck, for lights will be needed when law is argued over shining letters. Sel Corvane pays you in coin and in a pass because you did not meddle, but he does not thank you because you stole his rumor from his hand and gave it to a court that might not love engineers. Yarik Nine-Fingers curses you with the tired affection of a man who wanted your help and got your fairness, and he warns that fairness does not buy bread in the ring of bones and cranes. Your name, however, sharpens into the sort of edge both sides reach for when they decide to cut clean rather than ragged, and the city breathes this tide with a little less gossip and a little more watchfulness, which is a kind of peace that can be built upon if hands are steady.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"2\"], \"next\": [\"4\", \"6\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Guild chalk that reveals stress lines in metal\"},\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Gatewright’s pass for ring-two ramparts\"},\n        {\"type\": \"coin\", \"description\": \"60 coin in sealed Guild tallies\"},\n        {\"type\": \"faction\", \"description\": \"Guild of Tidewrights favor: Temporary deputation as Gate Crown auxiliary during emergencies\"},\n        {\"type\": \"unlock\", \"description\": \"Access to certain control rooms under Saltwarden escort\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
