Mud steamed and sighed where the sea had laid its weight, and the arcs of the Leviathan’s Splay rose in pale crescents, each rib veined with weed, salt, and the faintest trace of starshine. Choirs in storm-blue habits came barefoot across the shining flats, humming countercurrents that tugged upon the heart as surely as the moon upon the water, and the white crabs gathered in drifting constellations, clacking like beads when prayer turned. Star-Prior Alion brought out the vow-knots steeped in blessed brine, and they gleamed like wet cordage pulled from a dream, ready to be tied where bone remembers and law can hear. But banners of salt-silk preceded Lady Maris Veyron’s retainers through the mist, and the incense they burned smelled of inheritance and courtroom dust, and the words sewn into their standards were old words sharpened anew. From the city, a bell no hand rang answered the hymn, the sound crawling along the flats like a low, bright serpent; Raithe’s bone-chime earring thrummed to it, and deep within the Tide-Gate Crown, the hidden star-tooth began to hum like a waiting engine. For an instant, the city’s inhale and exhale slipped their accustomed rhythm, and every chain and window and rib-bridge in Vyraleth seemed to hold its breath, listening for which note would claim the night. The procession faltered between factions, between law and lineage, between the remembered pact and the profit of forgetting, and on that knife-edge the Night of Knots began.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort the Tidebound Conclave procession safely across the exposed ribs at Leviathan’s Splay, keeping singers, bearers, and knot-keepers intact through mud-suck, sudden inrush warnings, and gathering onlookers.\",\n        \"Defend the rite from disruption by Lady Maris Veyron’s retainers pressing hereditary claims and by Ratchet Syndicate hardliners angling to seize the moment for leverage at the docks.\",\n        \"Assist Star-Prior Alion in tying a precise corrective counterknot upon breathing bone to damp and stabilize the dangerous shard resonance carrying between the Basilica and the Gate Crown.\",\n        \"Study and interpret the shifting rib-shadows and crab-lines to glean a fragment of the drowned saint’s song-key, a phrase of power fit to unlock concord between star and stone.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Alion Mareth\", \"lines\": \"Bind the flood, unbind the heart; that is our work and our risk, and it is never simple when so many hands reach for the same rope. Tonight the flats are our nave, the ribs our altar, and the knots we carry are liturgy written in cord, salt, and breath. Something else hums beneath all this holiness, something forged of brass teeth and starfall pride, and it will not bow to hymn alone unless the hymn is sung true. I smell ambition on the tide like eel-oil, and I would rather not cut a future from a tangle that could be untied with patience and courage. Stand with us, Raithe Calder, and if old claims try to ride our rite, then as you were taught upon the bone-bridge, choose where to plant your feet and make the flood flow around you instead of through.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Maris Veyron\", \"lines\": \"Do not dress theft in liturgy, Prior, and do not call it mercy when it is merely a new kind of tithe paid to unfamiliar hands. My grandmothers bled their palms on these same ribs to stake nets and oaths when the Conclave still muttered to shut doors and soot-smeared icons in backwater chapels. The sea remembers its princes, and memory is a currency you cannot mint without our salt, however prettily you sing your countercurrents. Tonight we bear incense and proof, not daggers, and we seek not to break your knot but to bind it properly to the lineage that first promised the flood a steward’s care. If the city is to breathe, let it be by lungs born to the task, not by borrowed bellows hidden behind cloister walls.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Raithe Calder\", \"lines\": \"If the sea keeps books, Lady, my father’s name is inked in its margins, and the page smells of false bells and sudden water where no water should have been. I have seen chant turn rust to patience, and I have seen chains turned by greed pull tides the wrong way until the very mud groaned; tonight feels like the cusp of both. You want to harness a hum that runs between a church and a gate, and I have felt that hum in my bones enough to know it does not love masters who call themselves rightful. Prior Alion, tell me where the knot needs a second hand, tell me where to put my buckler, and I will make a lane through incense and bluster for your singers to pass unbloodied. But hear me both: if anyone uses this night to claim more than safety for our city, I will cut their claim free like rot off a mooring line and let the tide take it where it deserves.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yarik Nine-Fingers\", \"lines\": \"You all talk about stewardship like it’s a fine rope and not a noose that tightens every time a ledger shakes or a bell tolls from some high, dry place none of us were invited to. We Ratchet folk mend what’s broken, and I smell a gear out of true across this whole mud-plain, a tooth set wrong by hands that don’t know torque from prayer. While you argue which ancestor gets to stamp their signet on a bone older than your family trees, my crews are choking on dues and watching gates close to prove a point about power. I did not come with knives, but I came with eyes and with the stubborn truth that if you sing a city out of step, cargo drowns and children cough salt for supper. Tie your knots if you must, Prior, but if the song shifts again and the flats start to breathe wrong, I will unspool your holy cordage with my teeth and dare your saints to stop me.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Hold the Line for the Conclave\", \"text\": \"Raithe plants his feet at the throat of the procession where the breathing rib narrows, sets his buckler forward, and lets the tide’s cold creep in until his bones speak the rhythm. He calls the singers in tight and teaches them the dock-formation stance that turns a crowd’s shove into a harmless sway, and he names each knot-bearer aloud so the white crabs learn the cadence of the procession’s guardians. To Lady Maris’s retainers he offers respect as if it were a stave held out before a stumble, but he insists on the Conclave’s right of way for this night and this night alone, reminding them that an oath loses power if taken by storm. When Ratchet hardliners press with loud truths that smell of grievance and oil, he meets them with the old Saltwarden stance that refuses to escalate, letting his silence and steadiness turn jeers into mutters and mutters into nothing at all. His bone-chime earring hums to the distant bell, and though his knee aches with the cold and the weight, he stands long enough that even the ribs seem to accept his watch and ease their breath to match his.\", \"outcome\": \"The rite passes through the choke point unbroken, and the Choir of Knots reaches the appointed rib before the inrush, their song holding steady like a lantern burning true in fog. Lady Maris’s retainers retreat two paces but watch closely, forced by Raithe’s measured firmness to witness rather than interfere, and their scribes scratch notes that will become speeches at Parliament instead of blades in the dark. Yarik’s hardliners spit and drift away to test the perimeters for other leverage, finding none where Raithe has posted hooklings with whistle codes learned from Iria Venn. Alion ties the first loop while Raithe blocks a last-minute surge, and the countercurrent catches, smoothing the dangerous resonance into a manageable hum that no longer claws the nerves. The night keeps its peace by the brittle width of a buckler, and the city exhales back into rhythm, granting Raithe the sober respect of those who know how hard it is to make nothing happen when everything wants to break.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Parley at the Rib with Lady Maris\", \"text\": \"Raithe lowers his buckler and steps into the incense haze, bowing neither low nor high, choosing a middle keen as a knife’s back. He speaks to lineage the way a sailor speaks to a storm, acknowledging its breadth and danger while reminding it that a clever hand can reef a sail without tearing it. He offers Lady Maris a ceremonial cord to touch during the tying yet binds that courtesy to the strict condition that no hereditary claim be spoken aloud or woven into the knot’s pattern, turning honor into a sealed vessel that cannot smuggle law. He tells a story of the Bone Bridge omens shared by poor and rich alike, of ribs that do not care whether a foot is shod in velvet or tar, only that it treads with care, and in the telling he invites her to show the city a different power: restraint. Over the hiss of the flats and the distant unnatural bell, he stakes the ground with words that weigh like mooring stones and offers a path where Lady Maris gains dignity now and arguments later without wrecking this night.\", \"outcome\": \"Lady Maris accepts the ceremonial cord with a chill smile that nevertheless concedes the moment, and her retainers sheath their rhetoric with audible reluctance. The incense thins, and the choir’s tones grow clearer, their countercurrent no longer snagging on the barbed wire of politics, while crab-constellations resettle as if approving the tempered claim. In Parliament days hence, she will wield this night as proof of magnanimity rather than conquest, but here on the flats she keeps her silence, and that silence is worth more than a hundred guards. Alion nods once to Raithe in gratitude, then sings the drowned saint’s phrase over the knot while Raithe watches Maris’s hand hover and stop precisely where he’d asked it to stop. The resonance slackens enough that Raithe’s earring ceases its fearful tremor, and the gate’s hidden tooth does not bite; the city’s breath resumes its patient work, and Raithe leaves with a rumor of truce hanging from his shoulders like a cloak.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Hunt the False Bell and Break the Echo\", \"text\": \"Raithe peers across the Splay through his windglass visor and sees the shimmer where air has been written, a narrow funnel carrying the bell’s voice along an unnatural path. He signals two choir-guards with knot-gestures and moves over mud that breathes in sleep-sobs, following the echo to a half-submerged pallet where a ratcheted frame and a light-crystal rig have been sunk to cheat the tide. The device stutters the Basilica’s song and splices it into the Gate Crown’s hidden cog, letting the city hear a command that was never given and feel a pull that was never meant. He cuts the lashings while the white crabs clatter around his boots like perturbed saints, and when a hardliner lunges from the mist with a hook, Raithe twists, takes the blow on his buckler’s rim, and answers with a flat pommel that persuades rather than maims. He hauls the shivering rig to the surface and smashes its heart with his rib-edge falchion’s spine, choosing the blunt force that breaks only the lie and leaves the water to carry away the rest.\", \"outcome\": \"The false bell falls silent, and the echo that had set the flats shivering fades as quickly as fog burned by a sudden sun, leaving behind the honest weight of the sea. The Conclave’s hymn rises without interference, and the starshard tooth in the Crown ceases its hungry hum, settling into the background murmur of big, sleeping machinery. Yarik’s crew scatters when they see their trick undone without blood, and their anger fixes on Raithe personally rather than on the rite, a debt that may be called in alleyways rather than on sacred ground. Alion takes the moment of quiet to draw the counterknot tight, and the rib under his hands exhales a long, slow sigh that carries sweet brine, like a patient given back a heartbeat. Raithe returns to the procession spattered with honest mud instead of treacherous glimmer, and although his enemies count his steps, his city counts them too and breathes easier for each.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Listen for the Drowned Saint’s Key Alone\", \"text\": \"Raithe kneels where the rib’s shadow stripes the mud in bands that look like the city’s rings, lays his Mnemos Leaf upon the wet bone, and presses his windglass visor over closed eyes. He lets the choir recede to a distant shoreline and seeks the thin voice beneath, the one that sounds like a memory being remembered by someone else and like a tide reversing itself on a map. He recalls the Basilica’s cold vastness and the way his throat closes when he tries to sing there, then speaks not with voice but with breath and touch, tracing the knot pattern in slow, deliberate loops until his fingers find a place that warms. The white crabs gather in a crescent and halt, and their stillness becomes a metronome by which the drowned saint’s key becomes visible in his mind’s dark: a descending phrase that tastes of salt and regret and vows that were kept so hard they cracked their keepers. He commits the phrase to the Mnemos Leaf with ember-ink, binding a single detail for later rite, and rises with the fragile weight of a new tool wrapped around his heart like a careful bandage.\", \"outcome\": \"The fragment of the drowned saint’s song-key settles into the knotwork as Alion sings, and the corrective loop takes on a subtle sheen, as if river water and starlight had agreed to share the same thread. The resonance smooths not merely to safe but to resonant, a harmony that promises to answer when called without demanding a price from innocent lungs and unknowing harbor-bells. Alion leans close and murmurs that the phrase will be needed when Parliament descends into storm over star and gate, and that Raithe’s ear, however scarred, was the instrument the night required. Lady Maris’s eyes flick once toward the rib as if she too hears something she would rather not admit, and she draws her cloak tighter, calculating the cost of songs she cannot legally own. Raithe leaves the flats with the Mnemos Leaf tucked safe and a private cadence in his step, knowing a door has opened between what the city sings and what it can be made to remember.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"3\", \"5\"], \"next\": [\"7\", \"10\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"Item\", \"description\": \"Consecrated knot-fiber upgraded for the Knot-Ring, capable of binding a single spoken promise against magical tampering until deliberately unbound.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Coin\", \"description\": \"40 coins in stamped brine-chits, paid from Conclave alms and certified by the Order of Mnemos.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Faction\", \"description\": \"Tidebound Conclave favor: a sealed Sanctuary writ promising shelter and advocacy should political persecution fall upon Raithe.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"Unlock\", \"description\": \"Access to rib-bridge shrines for private rites, including night hours when omens are clearest and tolls are waived.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
