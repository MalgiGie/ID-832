Yet of late the wind has learned an unnatural hush, a sucked-in breath held too long, as if someone has written silence across the air with a razor. Glider skins hang slack like defeated flags, and hooklings cling to boltholes with bare toes while their whistles die in their mouths. The Collegium whispers of illegal net-engines: lattices that comb the gusts and bottle stillness to be sold to merchants who fear storms more than they fear law. Raithe Calder knows these heights, having once cut a snarled line and hauled an apprentice from a gale that wanted to devour sound, and Dean Orrix Vant remembers the steadiness of his hands. Below, cliff markets quiver in uneasy truce as Ratchet Syndicate crews swear they only mend what breaks and Tidewright apprentices mutter that wind-thieves are a water problem, not theirs. Wind-oracles squint at cables the way luthiers sight a string and declare that a thief’s fingernails have scored the very grammar of the air. The Windglass Visor prickles with shimmer where currents have been written and rubbed raw, and the gantry bells stutter as if their tongues, too, are caught in net. Somewhere in that trembling stillness a young Aerie apprentice drifts, trapped in a calm pocket like a fly in amber, and somewhere nearby the paper trail of a commission waits with ink still fresh. Tonight the city will either breathe again, or choke on an eloquent silence sold by cowards.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Ascend the Skyhook gantries and use the Windglass Visor to trace where wind has been written and stolen.\",\n        \"Disable at least two net-engine anchors without letting them snap into the cliff markets below.\",\n        \"Rescue a trapped Aerie apprentice who fell into a siphoned calm pocket.\",\n        \"Recover proof of who commissioned the net-engines: invoices, marks, or signatures.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Orrix Vant\", \"lines\": \"Air is not chaos, Calder; it carries clauses and cadence, and those who study it learn to hear the punctuation that holds storms together. Someone has knifed commas into coffers and sold our pauses as if they owned the very breath between gusts, and that vulgar commerce offends more than pride. It wounds safety, it insults scholarship, and it puts pilots at the mercy of merchants who mistake quiet for control. Take your visor and climb the gantries, read the scars the way a historian reads soot on a palimpsest, and tell me where the sentences of the wind have been redacted. Do not let any anchor fall into the markets, for a single snapped hook can scythe four stalls and a child besides. If you find a trapped apprentice, you cut him free first and lecture him later, because the Collegium will weather embarrassment but not a funeral. Bring me true names and stamped marks, not rumors dressed in guild colors, and I will put the correct quills to the correct throats. If in the doing you can bind a knot between wind-law and water-law, know that I will speak for you on the Ring of Kites and write you a favor no ledger can balance. We write upon the air, yes, but we also must answer to it, and today it is asking where its stolen silence went.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Iria Venn\", \"lines\": \"Raithe, love, the hooklings whistle a cliff code the Cartel pretends not to know, but listen for the two-short-one-long by the cracked winch; that’s their way of saying there’s a dead patch ahead. The visor will show you shimmer like oil on slate, but trust your skin too, because when the wind is stolen the hairs on your arms lay down as if listening for a story that won’t be told. The Cartel hates that I say this, but some quiet is worth paying for when you are threading the black teeth of the Sablemere, and some quiet is just a bag over the mouth of a living thing. If you have to cut anchors, swing them outward and drop to the green water, not down to the markets, and I will bring a lantern skiff beneath to guide the splash away from boats. I hear the Aerie thinks the Ratchet crews are selling stillness by the bucket, but I also hear the Aerie once bought a hush on credit and never paid it back, so keep your proof neat. And Raithe—when you find the apprentice, talk to him before you scold; fear clogs the throat as surely as rope, and the right words can be a blade.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Yarik Nine-Fingers\", \"lines\": \"You come sniffing with Aerie spice on your boots and call it the odor of truth, but what I smell is scholars blaming grease for what ink bought. We fix lines that snap and winches that scream, and if someone has stretched silk into nets, maybe ask who ordered silk by the bolt and labeled it prayer flags. We don’t sell quiet, Calder; we sell the chance for a mother to hear her kid in a storm, and if that chance stinks of coin, well, everything in this city does. The anchors you’ll find were set with hands that never held a dock-iron, so mind where you lay blame, because my crews would jimmy them right if they were ours. You want proof, check the ledger-pockets sewn into the linings of those fancy counterweight bags; merchants hide invoices where the wind can’t carry them loose. Cut what you have to, but if you drop metal on the market I swear I will make the bone-keepers charge a toll on your own ribs. Bring me a name that deserves a hammer and I will lend you mine, but bring me theater and I will close the curtain with chain.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sel Corvane\", \"lines\": \"The Gatewrights do not string nets over cliff markets or comb wind like hair, but we do test banner baffles and emergency stilling veils, and I will not have the Collegium calling our safety measures theft. If my apprentices are seen near Skyhook, it is because we are measuring spillover shear from glider drafts that rattle our gate banners, and there is a memorandum filed in the Glass Parliament to that effect. Wind-law and water-law have tripped each other’s feet since before you were born, Calder, and every time we try to bind a compromise the Aerie turns it into a sermon on the freedom of air. You may climb, you may look, you may even cut, but any equipment marked with the Guild’s sigil comes to me unbroken, or I will petition to pull your ring-rights for endangering floodworks. While you’re up there, rescue any fool child you find because we are not monsters, but bring me the invoices before you let the Aerie feign innocence with a choir. Should you discover that a rival framed our banner trials as net-engines, I will expect your tongue to speak as neatly as your blade cuts. And if it is our fault, I will own it in public, but only with documents in my hand and not a poet’s accusation in my ear.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Raithe Calder\", \"lines\": \"I’ve heard a false bell rob a man of breath and felt a true gale give it back, so I’ll not mistake quiet for safety or wind for chaos. I’ll climb with the harness snug, visor down, and blade sheathed until the rope bites, and I’ll cut only where the city won’t bleed. The anchors I find will come loose to the seaward drop, not through the backs of market tents, and I’ll signal with three quick tugs before I swing any weight. There’s a boy or girl up there learning how fear flattens sound, and I owe the Aerie more than a lecture, so that child comes home before any guild gets satisfaction. Bring me the marks and invoices, you say; well, I’ve carried paper that burned my hands before, and I will carry it again to the desk where it must be read. If this trouble was bought by Ratchet coin or Tidewright pride, I will say so, and if it was bought by someone who smiles during funerals, I will say their name twice. And Dean, if I can bind any peace between cable and current today, consider it a knot I tie with my best rope.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"A\", \"title\": \"Unspool the Quiet with a Public Knot\", \"text\": \"You choose to make the wind’s return a lesson rather than a battle, staging a careful unspooling with witnesses from each faction. You signal Iria to bring a lantern skiff beneath the worst anchors, then use your hook-harness to swing the weights seawards while hooklings whistle their cliff code to keep the markets clear below. With the Windglass Visor you trace the scratch-script of the net-engines to their hubs and loosen the clamps one by one, keeping the cliff-beams singing instead of screaming. You coordinate a rope line so Yarik’s crew can catch any errant gear and insist Sel’s apprentices log each piece recovered, quelling the reflex to accuse by drowning it in procedure. Midway through, you locate the calm pocket like a glass bubble and talk the terrified apprentice into moving toward your voice before you cut a seam in the stillness with your falchion’s flat. When the air breathes again, you gather the invoices hidden in the counterweight linings and have each guild witness the seals before you wrap them in oilcloth.\", \"outcome\": \"The markets cheer not for spectacle but for the simple relief of breeze returning, and your restraint earns you handshakes instead of thrown crates. Orrix Vant declares the demonstration a proof-of-concept in cross-guild safety and offers you the promised sky-debt along with a favor marked in the Collegium rolls. Yarik grudgingly admits your ropes kept his people from injury, and while he mutters about scholars, he opens a ledger and points to marks you missed, guiding you to a name without surrendering his pride. Sel Corvane, seeing her apprentices treated fairly, signs the receipt of recovered parts and, with a clipped nod, agrees to a joint review instead of a petition war. The invoices expose a quiet-lease broker working through a private room above the Brine Exchange with ties to a Cartel splinter, giving you a clean villain to name and a paper trail that will survive any choir. Your rescue of the apprentice becomes a story told on the gantries, and the child’s thanks places a small, steadfast loyalty in the Aerie that no coin could buy.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"B\", \"title\": \"Cut Hard, Name Hard\", \"text\": \"You take the fast, sharp path that the wind itself might approve of, choosing decisive cuts over delicate knots. You count the beat of the gusts under your breath and sever two net-engine anchors in perfect sync with a swell, flinging them past the cliff’s shadow into deep water and away from the stalls. You ride the line to the calm pocket and haul the apprentice into your chest as if pulling him from a well, then you kick free and let the rebounding gust carry you to the next rig. In the counterweight’s stitched lining you find invoices stamped with a guise you recognize as a Ratchet cut-rate seal, and you do not stop to ask who borrowed whose stamp. You strip the remaining clamps, slice the hush-bags like rotten fruit, and let the wind pour out with a howl that turns heads from three gantries away. With proof in your belt and the child breathing hard against your shoulder, you march straight to Orrix and the Saltwardens’ nearest patrol and name names like dropping anchors onto a thief’s boat.\", \"outcome\": \"The stillness breaks in a rush, and pilots cheer while stall-keepers grip their awnings as the honest gusts return; no one is hurt, and the cliffs feel alive again. Orrix accepts the evidence with public gratitude and private alarm at the stamp you brandish, and he pays your coin and sets aside your guaranteed wind-slot with no quibble. Yarik’s face goes tight as cable when he sees the seal, and he roars that forgeries walk more easily than truth in Vyraleth; he vows an internal purge, whether guilty or not, and the Ratchet hardliners spit your name like a chip of grit. Sel Corvane watches your clean cuts and cannot fault the safety of your method, but she complains that you should have cataloged before cutting; you shrug and let the wind answer for you. The invoices trace through a Ratchet-linked broker and a shadow account near Dry Dock Three, enough to trigger investigations and seize hush-bags before they spread, even as the docks brace for retaliatory strikes. The apprentice you saved tells any who will listen that you were the only voice that could reach him inside the quiet, and your name travels the gantries with a new edge.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C\", \"title\": \"Bind the Evidence, Balance the Law\", \"text\": \"You decide the city needs less theater and more leverage, aiming to keep the issue from exploding into a guild war that will starve the outer rings. Before climbing, you send a runner to Sel Corvane with a knot-ring message promising any Guild-marked hardware returned unbroken if she will certify that her banner trials are not to blame. On the gantries, you dismantle the worst net-engines with surgeon care, sliding clamps into sacks labeled for the Guild and the Aerie, and you use your visor to sketch the scratch-script onto your Mnemos Leaf for impartial recall. You whisper to Iria to stand by with her skiff in case the anchors slip, but you keep her lantern low; the point is to restore breath, not to blind enemies into new mistakes. You talk the stranded apprentice through panic with slow sentences about rope and bone and tide and let him crawl along your voice until your hands can take his weight. In the counterweight’s lining you find invoices that point both to a private Exchange room and to a Tidewright-friendly broker, a thread that would tear more fabric than it mends if yanked in public.\", \"outcome\": \"You deliver the living apprentice to Orrix and the marked hardware to Sel, and by sharing both the care and the burden you cool heads that were primed to flare. Orrix bristles at the redacted copy you hand him first, then steeples his fingers when you produce the full seals under promise of a closed session; he pays you and records a Collegium favor while agreeing to pursue the broker without a sermon. Sel signs a joint custody of the parts and, with visible relief, confirms her apprentices’ tests were not the thief’s work, then quietly offers you a look at bypass maps should you ever need to thread the Gate’s underways. Yarik snarls that secrets breed rust, but when he realizes you did not throw his crews to the Saltwardens, he grinds out a grudging promise to help you find who forged which stamp when fists are not watching. The invoices, handled carefully, reveal a Cartel-adjacent fixer who triangulated orders between wind-fearing merchants and a Tidewright ally hungry for leverage in Parliament, and by exposing them together you break the engine of the scheme instead of just its teeth. The story that spreads is not of a hero’s shout but of a steady hand that kept three ropes from sawing each other apart, and in a city of arguments that counts as a kind of legend.\"}\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"4\"], \"next\": [\"6\", \"8\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Windglass tuning shard that improves reading of aeromancy, sharpening the visor’s ability to reveal written gusts.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"coin\", \"description\": \"70 coin in stamped brass chits paid from the Collegium’s repair purse.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"faction\", \"description\": \"Brass Aerie Collegium favor: a guaranteed wind-slot for one critical departure, honored even in crowded skies.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"unlock\", \"description\": \"Temporary access to Skyhook cliff gantries without toll, recognized by pilots and winch-masters alike.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
