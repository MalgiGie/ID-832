Choristers far off in the Basilica braided their drowned names into a hum, and the floor-text unscrolled itself in mirrored sentences that only patience could read. Raithe Calder stood at the threshold beneath banners wet with fog, the Hook-Harness biting his shoulders and the bone-chime in his ear answering a bell no hand rang, while petitioners clustered behind Nella Shuck in a human chain of callused hands and stubborn hearts. Saltwardens in eel-skin coats formed a counter-line within, their shields painted with omen stripes that once told him where to set his feet, and Captain Brask Ilyne watched the tide of people as a broker watches the tide of coin. In the cold center, under a fissure stitched with luminous grout that hungered for a lie, the Order of Mnemos arranged ink and bowls like surgeons of memory, and Abbatess Serene Khel laid out the Ember Page that remembered heat and truth. House Veyron’s advocates moved like courtesy sharpened down to wire, their smiles bright as hooks and their documents heavier than chain, while a clerk in pale gloves counted time with a quill that skimmed days more than it recorded them. The Lantern Cartel’s light from a high balcony struck the glass plates in faint codes Raithe could read by reflex, promising safe passage if he could keep the hall from boiling. From the Whisperfen, Keth Borrowed-Tongue waited with eyes like still channels, ready to let the marsh speak again through his throat if the city would listen. Law was written on water here, and like water it could cleanse, carve, or drown, depending on whose hands kept the gates, whose breath held, and who dared to speak when the grout began to glow.\",\n      \"objectives\": [\n        \"Escort Nella Shuck and petitioners into the Glass Parliament without bloodshed.\",\n        \"Present the Ember Page and the memory-knot from Whisperfen to the clerks of the Order of Mnemos.\",\n        \"Hold the floor while Abbatess Serene conducts a recall, protecting Keth Borrowed-Tongue as witness.\",\n        \"Expose the bribed clerk siphoning days from the tithe vaults without letting the hall dissolve into violence.\"\n      ],\n      \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Nella Shuck\", \"lines\": \"We have shouted outside these doors until our throats bled salt, and I am tired of the echo giving us back only our own hurt. Today we walk inside with proof heavy enough to crack marble, and we will lay it on their shining letters until even the glass cannot pretend to look away. Stand with us, Raithe, not as a cudgel swung by some patron’s wrist, but as a spine that does not bend unless the city’s breath must pass. I will not let my people be trampled by pedigrees and fees again, not while my ribs still remember the cold of the Bone Bridge and the bruises from their shields. Walk at my side where the chain is thinnest and where fear points its blade; hold your buckler low so they can see our faces and not just our defiance, and remind me, if I forget, that we came to be heard rather than to break.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Brask Ilyne\", \"lines\": \"Order floats all hulls, Calder, and courts are the keel, and I am paid to keep barnacles of chaos from eating the wood. If you bring riot into my hall, I will flood ring five in paperwork and choke the quays on injunctions until even your hooklings cannot find work without a writ. Keep your Wharfers in their lanes and I will let your evidence breathe, because coin fears fire and so do I when the grout begins to glare like a storm at noon. You know what a rush looks like when lines break; hold your chain polite and I will hold my line restrained, and perhaps we will both walk away with fewer bruises than pride. But if a single lantern is smashed, I will answer it with oars and orders, and you will remember why we paint stripes on shields to tell men where not to step.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Serene Khel\", \"lines\": \"Silence is not peace, and I have presided over too many quiet rooms where truth drowned under the weight of courtesy. Allow me to draw memory from the marsh like a thread from a loom, and let that thread be strong enough to stitch a wound instead of bind a gag. If it shows an oath bent, the grout will glow and law will have to look at its reflection, even if the face in the glass looks like a prince’s and not a pauper’s. Raithe, hold the human chain at the doors with respect and not force, for a chain sworn to keep order can be a lifeline if the hall begins to heave like a boat. I ask you to keep Keth Borrowed-Tongue safe not because he is precious, but because the city will not forgive us if we teach it to fear its own remembered voice.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Keth Borrowed-Tongue\", \"lines\": \"On the night in question, a vow said one thing and meant another; the water took it in and kept its shape like a reed keeps wind, and I kept the water’s word. If you are brave, you will let the city hear itself speak and live with the sentence, for the fen does not judge, it only repeats, and men put the edge on repetition. I do not speak for myself, for my voice is a ferry and not a destination, and what it carries belongs to currents older than law. If I falter, pinch my wrist and I will remember a woman who lost her name and found her oath where lilies cover old pylons, and I will continue as she did, steady as rope and twice as wet. Do not let hands take me when the grout burns bright, because hands that steal words will drown in them later, and I would rather they learn to breathe where confession is thinner than fear.\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Maris Veyron\", \"lines\": \"It is a fearful thing to pour fever into law, and this Ember Page you dangle promises to boil more than tea in the Glass Parliament. I have worn courtesies like armor since I was sworn, but even silk blisters when truth is set too close to the skin, and I would spare the city a scar if I could. House Veyron remembers its duties no less than its privileges, and we will hear the rite as citizens before we plead as princes, though the river knows our name like tide knows moon. Yet know this, Raithe Calder: if the grout glows at a tale bent by envy or ignorance, then we will answer with the weight of our archives and the winter of our ledgers, for memory must not be counterfeited even by zeal. Walk carefully as you carry your proof, because a page can be a bridge and a knife, and I would prefer not to bleed where the city drinks.\"}\n      ],\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\"id\": \"C1\", \"title\": \"Walk as Shield, Not Spear\", \"text\": \"You station yourself at the head of the chain with Nella, buckler low and palm open, and you speak to the Saltwardens as if they were river-kin rather than rivals. You coach the petitioners to breathe with the gate-bells, to step on the count that keeps crowds from tripping themselves, and to name themselves out loud so they feel seen rather than herded. You repeat the promise that no lantern will be struck and no banner torn, and you remind Brask Ilyne of the time you stood in his line and learned which blows break bones and which break trust. You trade hard looks for harder courtesies and keep your blade sheathed even when a shoulder checks you against a pillar, because a bruise is cheaper than a blood stain on glass. When you reach the floor, you kneel to lay the Ember Page on its circle as if you were placing a keel on a slip, and you ask the hall to breathe with you rather than against you.\", \"outcome\": \"The Saltwardens ease their shields apart by a finger’s breadth and let the chain thread through, and the whisper that follows is relief rather than rage. Brask gives you a curt nod that admits memory of your refusal on the Parliament steps without making a show of forgiveness, and his men plant their feet where you ask rather than where habit would put them. Abbatess Serene’s rite begins with a hush so deep you can hear the tide write its syllables under the plates, and Keth’s borrowed words rise without a fist trying to shove them back down. When the luminous grout flares at the first false turn in the oath, the benches tense but do not break, because you have balanced a blade on your palm and convinced both sides to stare at the edge rather than grab it. By the time the rite ends, House Veyron’s advocates are pale as fogglass and the clerk’s quill shakes, and you hold the space long enough for the Order of Mnemos to bind what must be bound without a single lantern shattered.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C2\", \"title\": \"Signal the Beacons\", \"text\": \"You tip your windglass visor at the gallery until it catches a Lantern Cartel blink, and you answer in clean code that asks for a pause in convoy calls to keep merchants seated and not storming the exits. You trust Iria Venn’s unseen hands to bend light the way you once bent a riot line, and you gamble that Brask will value a calm hall over punctual ledgers. You warn Nella that this is a dangerous favor because pilots sell time for bread, and she agrees to pay the price in public thanks rather than coin that would compromise her stand. You reach the floor as the bell-buoys beyond the estuary fall strangely silent, as if the city inhaled and held its breath with you, and the murmurs in the Senate circle settle into something like listening. You place the Ember Page and draw attention to the beacons you will restore when the truth has been spoken, wagering the Cartel’s prestige on the hall’s patience and your promise.\", \"outcome\": \"The pause buys a span without interruptions, and Brask’s eyes flicker to the schedules he keeps behind his teeth before he gives an irritable wave that keeps his men still for the rite. Iria’s coded light feels like a hand in your palm, and the petitioners sense that someone beyond the hall watches their courage and takes some of the fear’s weight. House Veyron’s counsel hisses that you manipulate the city’s arteries, but Serene’s chant rises like a tide that does not care for noble breath, and Keth’s voice arrives across the marsh of minds with clarity. When the grout flashes, the silence holds and the signal lamps remain dark, making the glow impossible to ignore and impossible to drown in clamor, and you feel a victory measured in heartbeats rather than cheers. After, the Cartel will send you a folded chit that carries both gratitude and a warning to spend such favors sparingly, and Nella will squeeze your shoulder with pride and a promise to stand a human chain for a pilot if ever the need arises.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C3\", \"title\": \"Name the Siphon Aloud\", \"text\": \"You step into the circle of light and speak the clerk’s name in a voice that remembers command but is tempered by the humility you bled to keep. You describe the way eel-skin gloves can be reversed to hide ink-stains and how memory-ink cools in the well in the Hall of Winter Ledgers, and you invite the hall to look for the tremor in the hand that steals days rather than writes them. You hold up your Mnemos Leaf where ember-ink glows in truth’s presence and recount the night you escorted Serene through Whisperfen, laying a chain of detail as precise as any tidewright’s measure. You look at the Saltwardens first and tell them why a stolen day rots a ledger faster than salt eats iron, and you look at the Wharfers next and warn them that a riot would give thieves their fog. You end by asking the clerk to speak in his own defense before the grout answers, because the city deserves the dignity of a confession and the mercy of a witness who learns to breathe again.\", \"outcome\": \"The hall lurches toward uproar and then steadies, because your demand is a hand held up between a thrown punch and a face, and both sides recognize the saving of pain. The clerk’s quill scratches a denial that the grout answers with a sudden blaze, and the luminous seam throws a pale noon across his pale mask until he wilts like wet paper. Brask steps in with professional disgust rather than rage, and his men take the clerk by the arms without breaking a nose or a bench, because you have given them permission to be decent. Nella’s chain sways with a danger-song and then stills as she calls her people to witness rather than to strike, and Serene’s voice threads through the moment to tie it tighter than fear. Keth repeats the marsh’s echo of a bent vow, and the hall exhales not as a brawl but as a verdict, leaving you standing in a space you protected by naming the rot without demanding blood to rinse it.\"},\n        {\"id\": \"C4\", \"title\": \"Set a Quiet Snare\", \"text\": \"You step back from the center and move along the hall’s shadowed edge where guards watch less and whispers travel farther, and you bait the siphoning clerk with a rumor about a ledger stored in the Bone Bridge’s toll niche. You wet your Knot-Ring and tie a promise to the post of a side door, swearing in a voice only the vow can hear that you will not spill blood in this hall if truth presents itself in your hand. You ask a Mnemos novice for a cup of cooling ink and borrow a scriptor’s stamp, and you mark your Mnemos Leaf with a detail only a thief would try to match, trusting the ember-ink to flare if he touches it. You speak to the clerk softly about your own tithed days and let him believe you have a grievance that could be sold, and you feel the hook set as he reaches with greed rather than courage. You return to the circle as Serene begins the recall, and you let your trap spring at the moment when silence is deepest and all eyes can see the flare that betrays a stolen future.\", \"outcome\": \"The novice gasps when the ember-ink climbs the clerk’s fingers like foxfire, and the hall watches a confession written without words while the grout glows in stern agreement. Brask’s order comes like a clap and not a crash, and the arrest is cleaner than most handshakes you have known, which keeps the petitioners from flinching into fight. Nella’s eyes gleam with satisfaction at guile used to keep bodies whole, even as a few firebrands mutter that they wanted a louder justice, and you make a note to walk with them later where anger can cool without shaming courage. Serene nods once at your restraint and folds the moment into her chant, using the calm to pull Whisperfen’s thread straight through Keth’s throat with no hand to snatch it. The rite concludes with benches intact and a thief unmasked, and though House Veyron’s advocates look like statues about to crack, they choose words over weapons because you denied them the excuse of chaos.\"\n      ],\n      \"connections\": {\"previous\": [\"7\", \"5\"], \"next\": [\"9\", \"12\"]},\n      \"rewards\": [\n        {\"type\": \"item\", \"description\": \"Commons Bench token granting you the right to speak once per session.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"coin\", \"description\": \"30 crowns in clean, ledger-marked silver pressed into your palm after the hall empties.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"faction\", \"description\": \"Free Wharfers Assembly favor: crowd support when you call for a human chain or blockade.\"},\n        {\"type\": \"unlock\", \"description\": \"Reduced mooring dues for your declared household for one season.\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"
