"{\n  \"name\": \"Raithe\",\n  \"surname\": \"Calder\",\n  \"age\": 32,\n  \"race\": \"Human\",\n  \"appearance\": {\n    \"description\": \"Broad-shouldered dock fighter with rope-burned hands and a glider-pilot’s sure stance. River-brown hair cut short for helm fit, sea-gray eyes, and skin weathered by salt and kiln-ash. Favors layered eel-skin and canvas under a bone-rib pauldron.\",\n    \"distinctive_signs\": \"A crescent scar across the ribs like the city’s ring map; knotwork tattoos of the Tidebound vow on left forearm; broken Saltwarden badge worked into his belt; a bone-chime earring that hums faintly in fog.\"\n  },\n  \"class\": \"WARRIOR\",\n  \"history\": \"Born in ring five beneath the shadow of the Leviathan Bone Bridge, Raithe Calder grew up counting time by the chain-song of the tide-gates. His mother tied rope for Free Wharfers crews; his father shipped with a Saltwardens patrol skiff and did not return from a sudden inrush on Leviathan’s Splay when a false bell tolled from the Salt Spires. Raithe took up the shield early, first breaking gang-lines for warehouse masters and later enlisting with the Saltwardens Consortium to keep grain and glass moving after the Fire Tide. He learned dock-formation combat, riot shields, and how to read omens off the rib-bridge’s shadows. During the Mooring Strikes, he was ordered to crack a human chain of Wharfers on the Parliament steps; he refused, broke ranks, and lost his badge. With work scarce, he was hired as a sword-arm by a Tidewright foreman on the Tide-Gate Crown. There Raithe fought off a Ratchet Syndicate crew trying to seize the lever-room, only to discover the gate’s heart-cogs sing when the Basilica’s choirs call the Drowned Star. Troubled by the hidden starshard tooth rumor, he carried what he thought were medicine crates through a bypass tunnel for a friend of a friend—only later realizing they were precision gear teeth destined for illicit gate repairs. When a brawl over the shipment left a man bleeding on the basalt, Raithe bargained with the Order of Mnemos. Abbatess Serene Khel herself presided as he tithed three days of youthful memory into the Hall of Winter Ledgers in exchange for clemency and a vow to serve as escort on sensitive errands. He later guarded a Mnemos scriptorium visit to Whisperfen, cutting down thought-leeches and steering novices by knot-charms through memory-loss vapors, and Serene promised his sealed memories would not be sold. Raithe’s path crossed the Aerie of Brass when Dean Orrix Vant hired independent blades to protect wind-hearts after a mysterious stillness at Skyhook Cliffs. Raithe cut a snagged kite-line and hauled an apprentice to safety in a gale that wanted silence, earning Orrix’s reluctant respect and a windglass visor in thanks. Through all of it, Iria Venn—his childhood friend who rose to pilotage in the Lantern Cartel—slid him beacon schedules and fog codes, even as Cartel politics soured their meetings. Raithe now works as a free lance between factions, escorting Tidebound rites on the Leviathan’s exposed ribs, keeping Parliament petition lines from breaking, and hunting the truth of the two starshards that make the city breathe.\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Rib-Edge Falchion\",\n      \"description\": \"A broad, single-edged blade forged around a sliver of leviathan rib, weighted for cleaving mooring chains and boarding lines; etched with tide-marks to read depth by feel.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saltwarden Buckler\",\n      \"description\": \"A round eel-skin shield reinforced with brass rim; still bears faded omen stripes used to signal formations on the quays.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Hook-Harness\",\n      \"description\": \"Canvas-and-leather climbing rig with iron hooks and a quick-drop line for gateworks, glider gantries, and rib-bridges.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Knot-Ring of the Conclave\",\n      \"description\": \"A brass ring braided with consecrated fibers; when tied and wetted, its knot holds a spoken promise until deliberately unbound.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Windglass Visor\",\n      \"description\": \"A tinted lens set in a simple brow-band, gifted by the Aerie; cuts glare off water and reveals subtle shimmer where air has been ‘written’ by aeromancers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mnemos Leaf\",\n      \"description\": \"A palm-sized sheet of unburnable parchment marked with ember-ink; can fix a single witnessed detail to be recalled by licensed rite.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"main_attributes\": {\n    \"strength\": 16,\n    \"agility\": 13,\n    \"constitution\": 15,\n    \"intelligence\": 11,\n    \"wisdom\": 12,\n    \"charisma\": 10,\n    \"dexterity\": 14,\n    \"endurance\": 16,\n    \"perception\": 13,\n    \"luck\": 9\n  },\n  \"soft_skills\": [\n    \"Dockyard tactics and crowd control\",\n    \"Tide-law etiquette and oath protocol\",\n    \"Basic glider rigging and wind-signal literacy\"\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": {\n    \"Serene Khel\": \"Abbatess of the Order of Mnemos who oversaw Raithe’s memory tithe after a dockside brawl; she employs him as an escort on sensitive errands and holds the key to the sealed days he traded.\",\n    \"Iria Venn\": \"Childhood friend turned Lantern Cartel pilot; they exchange fog codes and favors despite clashing loyalties, and a not-quite-spoken affection runs between them.\",\n    \"Orrix Vant\": \"Dean of the Brass Aerie; Raithe saved one of his apprentices during a stillness at Skyhook Cliffs and earned a guarded respect and a single favor, though Orrix distrusts Raithe’s ties to Tidewrights and Wharfers alike.\"\n  },\n  \"ambitions\": \"Win ring-rights for his scattered household, expose the hidden starshard in the Tide-Gate Crown without plunging Vyraleth into chaos, and broker a standing peace between Wharfers, Tidewrights, and pilots so the city inhales and exhales without blood.\",\n  \"flaws\": \"Short-fused when authority bullies the weak; keeps dangerous secrets to protect friends; superstitious about singing in the Basilica; knee twinge from a bad fall on Skyhook Cliffs slows him on ladders.\",\n  \"dreams\": \"A small home by the Leviathan Bone Bridge where the rib’s shadows fall right, a workshop teaching hooklings to fight fair and tie true knots, and a city where the bells ring only for weather and not for war.\",\n  \"secrets\": \"Raithe once ferried a crate of precision gear teeth through the Tide-Gate bypass tunnel, believing it medicine; the shipment included a starshard-set cog now rumored to hum in the Crown.
