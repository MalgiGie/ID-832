        "description": "Broad-shouldered dock fighter with rope-burned hands and a glider-pilot’s sure stance. River-brown hair cut short for helm fit, sea-gray eyes, and skin weathered by salt and kiln-ash. Favors layered eel-skin and canvas under a bone-rib pauldron.",
        "distinctive_signs": "A crescent scar across the ribs like the city’s ring map; knotwork tattoos of the Tidebound vow on left forearm; broken Saltwarden badge worked into his belt; a bone-chime earring that hums faintly in fog."

    "class": "WARRIOR",
    "history": "Born in ring five beneath the shadow of the Leviathan Bone Bridge, Raithe Calder grew up counting time by the chain-song of the tide-gates. His mother tied rope for Free Wharfers crews; his father shipped with a Saltwardens patrol skiff and did not return from a sudden inrush on Leviathan’s Splay when a false bell tolled from the Salt Spires. Raithe took up the shield early, first breaking gang-lines for warehouse masters and later enlisting with the Saltwardens Consortium to keep grain and glass moving after the Fire Tide. He learned dock-formation combat, riot shields, and how to read omens off the rib-bridge’s shadows. During the Mooring Strikes, he was ordered to crack a human chain of Wharfers on the Parliament steps; he refused, broke ranks, and lost his badge. With work scarce, he was hired as a sword-arm by a Tidewright foreman on the Tide-Gate Crown. There Raithe fought off a Ratchet Syndicate crew trying to seize the lever-room, only to discover the gate’s heart-cogs sing when the Basilica’s choirs call the Drowned Star. Troubled by the hidden starshard tooth rumor, he carried what he thought were medicine crates through a bypass tunnel for a friend of a friend—only later realizing they were precision gear teeth destined for illicit gate repairs. When a brawl over the shipment left a man bleeding on the basalt, Raithe bargained with the Order of Mnemos. Abbatess Serene Khel herself presided as he tithed three days of youthful memory into the Hall of Winter Ledgers in exchange for clemency and a vow to serve as escort on sensitive errands. He later guarded a Mnemos scriptorium visit to Whisperfen, cutting down thought-leeches and steering novices by knot-charms through memory-loss vapors, and Serene promised his sealed memories would not be sold. Raithe’s path crossed the Aerie of Brass when Dean Orrix Vant hired independent blades to protect wind-hearts after a mysterious stillness at Skyhook Cliffs. Raithe cut a snagged kite-line and hauled an apprentice to safety in a gale that wanted silence, earning Orrix’s reluctant respect and a windglass visor in thanks. Through all of it, Iria Venn—his childhood friend who rose to pilotage in the Lantern Cartel—slid him beacon schedules and fog codes, even as Cartel politics soured their meetings. Raithe now works as a free lance between factions, escorting Tidebound rites on the Leviathan’s exposed ribs, keeping Parliament petition lines from breaking, and hunting the truth of the two starshards that make the city breathe.",

    "secrets": "Raithe once ferried a crate of precision gear teeth through the Tide-Gate bypass tunnel, believing it medicine; the shipment included a starshard-set cog now rumored to hum in the Crown. To shield Iria Venn’s name from the route notes, he deposited the memory of that night with the Order of Mnemos, sealed under Serene Khel’s authority. When the Pale fog creeps upriver, the bone-chime in his ear resonates to a bell no hand rings, and he fears the leviathan’s ribs remember him."
