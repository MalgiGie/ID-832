ZPB project

Procedural Content Generation and Natural Language Processing in RPGs â€“ Analysis of Implementation Feasibility

The aim of the project is to investigate the possibilities of implementing procedural content generation (PCG) and natural language processing (NLP) mechanisms in an RPG game. The research will include an analysis of the effectiveness of different approaches to dynamic world creation, quests and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs), with particular emphasis on the use of large language models (LLM) to simulate character conversations and motivations.
